"Aaron has always been fascinated by technology. At 10, he wrote his first line of code. At 22, he earned a degree in computer science. At 23, he led development of Steve Case’s RevolutionHealth. At 25, he cofounded Hungry Machine, later known as LivingSocial. And since 2015, he’s been a partner at Lightspeed with a focus on consumer technology.","

"It turned out to be a good thing. As CTO of one of the first “unicorns,” Aaron helped grow LivingSocial from four employees in 2007 to more than 4,500 in 2011. At its height, the company reached over 80 million consumers, scaled to 25 countries, and hit billions in global sales. The company was later acquired by Groupon.","

"Alex is inspired by both inventors and artists. As a teenager, he spent as much time in the laboratory conducting research as he did in concert halls performing for thousands. “I am drawn to the creative process,” he says. “Whether the output is an algorithm, a cantata, or something else entirely is less interesting to me.

"While studying physics at Harvard in the early 2000s, Alex witnessed the creativity of a few students who started a website called TheFacebook.com. “I didn’t think of Facebook as a business at the time,” he says. “I just knew that it tapped into something innate—our desire to be connected and to express ourselves.

I use data to find evidence of that behavior, and then I look for ways to scale it to the masses. When you have the insight, the data that validates it, and a path to market, that’s when you have something truly special.”","

I was on a really conventional path up to that point; banking, business school and consulting.” Then, serendipity stepped in.

But I come from a place of caring, and doing what’s right.”","
