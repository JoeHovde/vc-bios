"Connecting with people has always been my core competency — in business and in life — and I love that my work lets me blend the two. I get to partner with people I like to work with, support entrepreneurs who inspire me, and help them find the people and resources they need to go the distance. As such, my favorite moments on the job tend to have had less to do with just the financial returns, and more to do with the people involved and the relationships we build.   One of my favorite measures of success are the number of First Round founders who choose to come back to work with us on their next company.",Chris FralicPartner,First Round Capital

"I came to First Round through a series of connections myself. I had met Josh and Howard through the TED conference over 20 years ago, then worked with Josh at Half.com for years before running various groups at eBay and then business development at del.icio.us.  I kept an eye on the the newly-formed First Round as it developed it’s creative approach to venture capital, and when they needed help and I had a chance to join, I jumped on it.  We don’t say it often, but we’ve always thought that building First Round is building like a startup.   In that way I feel like we’re all working on disrupting an industry and serving our customers – the entrepreneurs – with the best product in the seed stage venture business.",Chris FralicPartner,First Round Capital

"Since joining First Round over a decade ago, I’ve worked with dozens of companies. Some have failed, some have scaled, some were acquired, some are now public – and they’ve all given me perspectives on how to be most helpful to entrepreneurs and how to build business relationships over time. I’ve been fortunate to partner with companies that range from physical products like Ring and Warby Parker to advertising and marketing tech like Invite Media, Flurry and Percolate. I have a particular interest in gaming and VR, which led to our investment in companies like Roblox.",Chris FralicPartner,First Round Capital
"For me, the most important characteristic of the best founders, the most successful sales or business development executives, or any relationship is empathy — making the effort to understand the experience of the other side.    Related to that, I’ve observed that the best founders don’t want to be told only what they want to hear.  Most everyone in a board room wants radical candor, so I try to provide the perspective other’s won’t when it’s needed.  That’s also why the ability to balance conviction with learning/reacting is the number one quality I look for in founders. They believe in what they’re doing so deeply, but they’ll also seek out the opinions and feedback they need.",Chris FralicPartner,First Round Capital

For the last five years, I was Co-CEO at Birchbox, growing it from launch to over a million monthly subscribers, and raising $70M in venture capital in the process.

"So how did I get here? Good question, especially considering that I spent the six months before joining First Round telling everyone who asked that I didn’t want to be a VC. And I’m not here because I changed my mind. I’m here because I so valued being a part of the First Round community that I wanted to remain a part of it and give back to it. I’m here because I believe that the way we do venture at First Round is unique. For us, it’s a team sport and a community endeavor, all done in service to the entrepreneur.",Hayley BarnaPartner,First Round Capital
"I knew from the moment I had my first conversation with Phin that I wanted First Round to lead Birchbox’s seed round. He explained the founders-first philosophy — that even if they disagree, they’ll let you know why of course, but support you in doing what you think is best. That they’d rather connect you to someone else who actually knows (including the many entrepreneurs they work with) than claim to know something they don’t. This could have been a lot of talk, but it bore out, and Phin was often my first call whenever times got tough.",Hayley BarnaPartner,First Round Capital
"As a recent entrepreneur, I know how critical having trust in your investors is. Now, I feel like I have a foot in both worlds. My founder experience is still fresh, but I can offer perspective from covered territory. When I joined First Round, I gave a lot of thought to the type of VC I want to be, and I decided to be one that wouldn’t hedge talking about mistakes and lessons hard won. I want to roll up my sleeves and leverage the skills that made me a good founder in the first place: I’m extremely data-driven, I believe all problems are solvable. I think creativity, teamwork and iteration can break through walls. Have a gnarly issue? Let’s hang out with a whiteboard for few hours and let’s jam.",Hayley BarnaPartner,First Round Capital
"I think that’s why I’m so interested in startups taking on problems we’ve all assumed were unsolvable, or things we didn’t realize were a problem until someone with a unique vision pointed it out to us and showed us it could be better. These unexpected, yet awesome companies are run by founders who know the world can be improved, and they won’t stop until it happens. Even if they don’t know yet exactly how they’re going to make that dent in the universe (and freely admit it), they know that dent’s gotta get made.",Hayley BarnaPartner,First Round Capital
"As an angel investor before joining First Round, I often asked people what impact they hoped their business will have had in five years. Some would say something quantifiable like, “We’ll have hit $XM in revenue and hired X people.” Others will respond with something much more lofty and mission-driven about what will have fundamentally changed for their industry or their customers. In my experience, the best companies are a blend of the two. Something big and ambitious and good that they can break into clear steps and measure success along the way.",Hayley BarnaPartner,First Round Capital
"Before Birchbox, I worked at Bain & Company and went to Harvard Business School (thus the focus on measurement and execution as well as deep experience with theme parties). But my proudest moment as an entrepreneur doesn’t have so much to do with returns or revenue. It’s that I was able to build a culture at Birchbox strong enough to thrive beyond my direct oversight. If I can help even a few founders feel this way, then I’ll consider my work here a success.",Hayley BarnaPartner,First Round Capital

"Growing up on hip-hop and hoops, I wanted to be a lot of different things. An NBA basketball player (I settled for the team at Haverford), an architect or a big money guy on Wall Street. I ended up making sneakers at AND1 — and I’ll never forget the first time I felt like a successful entrepreneur: I was walking through a mall in Houston and I saw a kid come out of a store with a new pair of shoes. He was lit up and pulled them out of the box to show his boys. They were a pair of AND 1 shoes I’d helped create. He had spent $85 on something we built. It was amazing.",Phin BarnesPartner,First Round Capital
"I think that feeling is at the heart of entrepreneurship and I want as many people as possible to feel it. That is why I work on Dorm Room Fund and why I am committed to fixing the UX of VC — making every touchpoint with First Round great — even if we don’t invest, I want you to walk away with something new that will help you build your business.",Phin BarnesPartner,First Round Capital
"I joined First Round because I wanted to be a better entrepreneur and knew I could learn a lot by spending a ton of time with First Round founders and partners. I’d spent the previous 10 years building companies, and going deep on product creation and brand building. I had some success and significant failures. I got introduced to Josh and actually started out as an intern — so if there’s a testament to how differently this firm works, that’s it. Years later, I’m still here because I saw how much opportunity there was to build First Round itself into an amazing company — and how much room there was to try new things that would have a huge ripple effect for our companies and their users. I don’t think I would have been a GP at any other firm.",Phin BarnesPartner,First Round Capital
"When I first started investing, I got excited about companies where I would have loved to be the CEO but the job was already filled by someone way better than me. I’ve learned a lot since, but what inspires me remains pretty similar: people who have an idea that won’t let go, founders who know they have to do something, who are compelled to do it now, and believe they’re the perfect ones to do it. Most of these people start with a remarkable understanding of their customer — Hayley and Katia at Birchbox, Oren at Area 1 Security, Talha at NimbleRx and Matt at Blue Apron are good examples — these founders told me something about a consumer that I’d never heard before.",Phin BarnesPartner,First Round Capital

"What’s cool about engaging with founders at the seed stage is that you’re there when they’re laying the foundation, and every action has incredible impact. I know I’m not the one in the office until 3 a.m. or sweating all the small stuff in the moment, but I like to think I can introduce new ideas into their field of vision that they can either reject or respond to. The best VCs don’t tell anyone what to do — they’re like having ESP, giving CEOs more perspective, helping them see around corners and start to think about the next challenge earlier than the competition. Great VCs provide information, context and support. The founder leverages this to make better decisions at an increasing pace.",Phin BarnesPartner,First Round Capital
My best moments are when founders call me to say thanks. I would never take credit for any of their success — it is theirs alone — but the thank yous for offering some piece of advice or some little insight that helped move the needle for them make this job awesome. The puzzle that eats at me is how can I help talented entrepreneurs bring their best every day. Sometimes that means asking dumb questions until you get to that 1 out of 10 that makes them think about something a different way or challenges a key assumption. Sometimes it’s re-anchoring them in their mission and why they embarked on this insane journey in the first place. A lot of the time it’s just listening and helping them rubber duck the problem.,Phin BarnesPartner,First Round Capital

They’re core to us building “the most powerful network in the Valley” (Fortune Magazine’s words, not ours), and I’m sure had something to do with me being named one of Forbes’ 30 Under 30 in venture capital in 2015 (even though I think these lists are pretty silly).",Brett BersonPartner,First Round Capital

"I was sold on joining First Round after realizing how core the community was to everything the team did. I saw how focused the partnership was on connecting entrepreneurs to each other and building a rich knowledge-sharing network. I immediately thought, “They’re solving the biggest pain point every founder has.”  This emphasis on community was an extension of a genuine focus on founder needs and wellbeing. I previously co-invested alongside Josh, Rob and Phin, and the things they did stuck with me: They’d re-invest in a founder they believed in, even if their first company failed. They’d overlook short-term economic interests in favor of long-term relationships. In an industry where the default is to optimize everything, this resonated with me.",Bill TrenchardPartner,First Round Capital
"Today, as a partner, I think this philosophy helps us find and work with the strongest startups out there. When prospective founders ask for references who can talk about First Round, I always point them to a few entrepreneurs whose companies didn’t work out. One of the best arguments in our favor is how we respond when things don’t go to plan. If we think a founder is brilliant, we want to see her succeed, now or in the future. We’re not going to hold someone back just to get ours.",Bill TrenchardPartner,First Round Capital
"Finding truly unique insights into a problem or market is very rare. But that’s also what makes it interesting to me. I invested early in Uber because they understood how painful the current cab experience was, and why that was the case.

"Taking on this type of challenge requires exceptional productivity. So, I look for founders who get a tremendous amount done in a short amount of time. High-velocity decision-making. They push themselves and their teams. When you’re running a small company, you have very few advantages over much bigger companies with established brands. Early on, speed is one of them, and it makes all the difference. Little things matter, like the meetings you take, the ones you don’t; how you make decisions; how you empower your team; how you manage your inbox; how you build a culture that embraces speed. You should always be thinking about how to get the flywheel spinning faster.",Bill TrenchardPartner,First Round Capital
"Moving faster, getting more done in less time has always been my goal as an entrepreneur and investor.  I fail all too often but think the pursuit is what matters. I’ve built teams from 0 to hundreds and lived through many of the car wrecks that happen along the way. Most of the founders I work with call me first when the shit is hitting the fan, because they know I’ve been there. I think systematically and can help break down problems, “Let’s worry about this first.”  I can talk about the management mistakes I’ve made, or the hundreds of fundraising conversations I’ve had on both sides of the table. I particularly love rolling up my sleeves to help them get from Seed to Series A.",Bill TrenchardPartner,First Round Capital

"I first experienced the wild ride of starting a company when I was in college at Wharton. While others were cramming for tests at all hours of the night, I decided to co-found a company called Infonautics Corporation and was fortunate to take it public on the NASDAQ in 1996. I then had this crazy idea to allow anyone to buy and sell used books, music and DVDs online and launched Half.com in July of 1999. The timing worked out and we were acquired by eBay in July of 2000. I followed Half.com with one more company called Turntide that Symantec quickly acquired.",Josh KopelmanPartner,First Round Capital

We chose to specialize, and that gives us clarity of purpose.",Josh KopelmanPartner,First Round Capital

I know that the advice I got from fellow entrepreneurs made all the difference for me at Infonautics, Half.com and Turntide. Finding them is usually the hard part. We aim to make that much easier, and it’s amazing to see how much this mindshare has accelerated many of our companies. We call all of these efforts “Platform” and it has become central to our firm for the last decade.

It’s incredible to see how much value leaders at our startups can get out of one hour spent with a domain expert, and how much time they save not having to research things or track down answers themselves.

"Before joining First Round, I worked in talent acquisition at Bloom Energy and SPMB. But my first job out of school was teaching eighth grade science with Teach for America — which was simultaneously grueling and extraordinarily rewarding. I’m a proud Boston College Eagle and have my MBA from UNC Kenan-Flagler. A native of San Francisco, you’ll find me cheering on all Bay Area sports teams and zooming around the city bumping 90’s R&B in my manual transmission.","Whitnie NarcisseVP, Platform: Talent & Community Resources",First Round Capital

"I’d argue that Dorm Room Fund is the best place in the entire world for a student to learn how to be an investor.  That’s because we don’t teach students how to invest from a textbook or through mock case studies.  Everything student partners work on is 100% real. They have real money to invest, fund real startups, and interface with real founders everyday. We don’t require previous investing experience in order to join the team. In fact, we look for students with varied backgrounds and skillsets, because we believe diversity of viewpoint enables better decision making.",Rei WangDirector of Dorm Room Fund,First Round Capital
