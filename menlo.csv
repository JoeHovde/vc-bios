"Shawn is a partner at Menlo Ventures, and focuses on IT investments in the consumer sector—with particular interest in major technological shifts that improve daily lives. Examples include current investments in Roku and Uber, as well as Siri, which sold to Apple in 2013.
Shawn received his BS and MS in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he graduated with highest honors, but was continually pulled into the field of computer science. His interests in programming led to the Chicago startup scene with Open Port Technology. As a manager of software architecture at Open Port, Shawn wrote wire protocols in C++ in the days before JSON and obtained his first patent. He left to attend Stanford GSB, with initial plans to become a business-savvy CTO. A summer stint at Booz Allen taught him to think big, but underscored his need to be on the cutting-edge of tech. He joined Menlo upon receiving his MBA in 2002.
Shawn’s learned countless left-brain lessons as a VC, software and electrical engineer, product manager, management consultant, and CEO, but none so impactful as the right-brain ones as a husband, father, and struggling founder as the former CEO of Handle, the world’s first (and only) priority engine. He believes in candor, empathy, and the Lean Startup principles born at IMVU, where he has served as a director since 2005. For fun, Shawn enjoys hiking with his family, running with his wife, Jennifer (founder of Reach Capital), snowboarding, and motorcycling.Current Investments

"Naomi joined Menlo Ventures as a partner in 2018, and brings deep operating experience across both product and growth. Her investment focus spans consumer and prosumer, or high-velocity B2B companies that scale using product-driven growth strategies. Naomi is especially fond of habit-forming products and subscription/SaaS business models that create more value for both customers and companies over time. As someone who has built new products from scratch, and helped existing products scale from 10M to over 100M users, she empathizes with entrepreneurs at every stage of the business and product lifecycle.
Naomi began her tech career in 2006, after brief stints working in industrial engineering and management consulting. She was most recently Vice President of Growth at Invoice2go, and prior to that, a product lead at Evernote, where she also founded the Growth team. Her expertise includes building high-performing teams, and driving retention and monetization. One example she’s particularly proud of is increasing customer upgrade rate by triple digits, while simultaneously increasing upgrade price by double digits, all without sacrificing customer sentiment. Naomi loves participating in the broader tech community as an advisor, and as a guest lecturer for programs such as Reforge and 500 Startups.
Naomi holds a bachelor of science degree in industrial engineering from Northwestern University, and an MBA from Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business. She lives in San Francisco with her husband and toddler, and takes any opportunity she can to travel somewhere new.

"Tyler is a partner at Menlo Ventures, and focuses on investments in both B2B and B2C markets. Additionally, he is passionate in backing technology-enabled services and products with the end user in mind. He loves annuities, network effects, liquidity moats, systems of records, and high frequency transactional and replenishment businesses that explicitly or implicitly keep customers around – ideally forever. He jokes that his goal is to back a business that one day Warren Buffet would like to buy because of its enduring value. He knows he’s running out of time.
Tyler looks for these types of opportunities across a wide variety of markets and verticals. He finds a lot of “scratch” in complex, often regulated, and highly profitable industries – like financial services, but he also finds plenty to get excited about in next generation SAAS and security, vertically integrated ecommerce, marketplaces, and data networks / connectivity, for a variety of industries.
Tyler’s investments include BlueVine, Bread, eShares, FiveStars, Homelight, PillPack, RealtyShares, Stance, tCell.io.
Previously, Tyler was a principal and senior investment analyst at Menlo, and sourced prior investments in EdgeCast Networks (sold to Verizon), DataXu, Dstillery, and ReadyForce. He also enjoyed a stint at Accel Partners in London, where he sourced investments Aorato (sold to Microsoft), GoCardless, FlyWire, and Calastone as an associate.
