"I think it’s very hard to be in venture capital if you haven’t walked in the shoes of a founder or entrepreneur, or been involved in building a company.",Roelof Botha,Sequoia Capital
"When it would have been easy to see YouTube as risky or frivolous, we saw it as having the potential to change the way the planet consumes media. We partnered with YouTube from the very beginning, incubating the three founders in our office. In the early days of YouTube, what mattered most was a clear-eyed vision of how the world would change once it felt the impact of user-generated content at a global scale. ",Roelof Botha,Sequoia Capital
"It is rare to find someone who can clearly and concisely identify a problem, and formulate a coherent approach to solve it.",Roelof Botha,Sequoia Capital
My greatest frustration is that I buy books faster than I can read them.,Roelof Botha,Sequoia Capital
"Your best teacher, your best mentor, was probably not the one you necessarily liked the best at the time. But they were the ones who pushed you the furthest to help you accomplish your best.",Roelof Botha,Sequoia Capital
"Schopenhauer said that talent hits a target no one else can hit, but genius hits a target no one else can see. That is precisely what sets founders apart.",Roelof Botha,Sequoia Capital
"The temptation for someone with an operating background is to step in and to try to solve the problems on their own, and tell the entrepreneur what to do. I think it’s not about supplying an answer. It’s having a conversation, because I don’t have the context of being inside the company 80 hours a week.",Roelof Botha,Sequoia Capital
"I didn’t know what I was going to do. I never had a plan to be in venture capital, or to be the CFO of a tech startup. I just knew there was a lot of opportunity in Silicon Valley and I had an intuition that I needed to be here.",Roelof Botha,Sequoia Capital
"If you take the safe path, you’re probably not going to end up doing something special.",Roelof Botha,Sequoia Capital
"It’s odd to me when entrepreneurs fear, “Oh my goodness, there’s a board, there’s authority, you guys now control my company.” We never control the company. We’re there to help.",Roelof Botha,Sequoia Capital
Obviously some board meetings are testier than others because that’s part of the point: to push people to do even better.,Roelof Botha,Sequoia Capital
The motto inside Sequoia is that we’re only as good as our next investment.,Roelof Botha,Sequoia Capital
Empathy. The ability to put yourself in someone else’s shoes is an under-appreciated skill.,Roelof Botha,Sequoia Capital
"I studied actuarial science, and our professor had this great quote that always stuck with me: “Accountants are trained to think one year in arrears. Actuaries are trained to think 25 years into the future.”",Roelof Botha,Sequoia Capital
"Imagination is ingrained in the training. Your brain is wired to think: What does the world look like in 2030, 2040? And it’s how I approach thinking about startups.",Roelof Botha,Sequoia Capital
"I wouldn’t send my brother to most VC firms, but some are great.",Roelof Botha,Sequoia Capital
"By the last semester at Stanford I’d run out of money. I came to the US in ‘98 right after the emerging markets currency crisis, so the money I’d saved up in South Africa to come to business school lost 40% of its value overnight. That’s when I joined PayPal.",Roelof Botha,Sequoia Capital
"Of course I was attracted to the company as well, but there was a very real need to pay rent the next month.",Roelof Botha,Sequoia Capital
"When I interviewed here, Sequoia had a spec: they were looking for someone with a computer science background who was working in product management at an enterprise software company.",Roelof Botha,Sequoia Capital
"All the nuances, all the third-order issues you see from inside the company, are very different from what a board member sees — even well-intentioned — when they’re only there once a month or even once a week.",Roelof Botha,Sequoia Capital
"There’s a very strong sense of humility inside our walls. Every day there are spectacular businesses being built, and there are more that we’re not involved with than that we are.",Roelof Botha,Sequoia Capital
"I’ve always been drawn to creative problems and people. But over the years, I found I truly enjoy day-to-day leadership and mentoring most of all.",Bill Coughran,Sequoia Capital
I’d describe myself as a technologist with general management experience.,Bill Coughran,Sequoia Capital
"We met Viptela early, when conventional wisdom may have dismissed the company as no more than a better WAN optimization. The founders, however, weren’t thinking about networks in the same way as everyone else. They saw a chance virtualize WAN networking, analogous to what VMware did to the server market and what Amazon was doing to data centers. Our first meeting with them stretched from 30 minutes to two hours, as each sentence in the conversation unlocked another compelling possibility.",Bill Coughran,Sequoia Capital
"Talented, passionate people don’t want to follow you to create a better future. They want to co-create it with you.",Bill Coughran,Sequoia Capital
"What I bring, maybe, is intellectual breadth, coupled with a lot of operational experience. I've certainly seen a broad collection of technologies, ranging from semiconductors up through large distributed systems and web and mobile services.",Bill Coughran,Sequoia Capital
"I went through a small college in Pasadena as an undergraduate, and basically, almost everybody who showed up there thought they were the smartest person in the room. It was an interesting experience to learn that you're not the smartest person in the room.",Bill Coughran,Sequoia Capital
"That taught me the importance of continuing to learn, and not being overly confident in your own abilities.",Bill Coughran,Sequoia Capital
"Management starts with listening. If you’re talking all of the time, you’re not listening.",Bill Coughran,Sequoia Capital
"Integrity and transparency are probably the most important things to me in business. I've spent too much time in organizations where people didn't want to be upfront, and it made things very difficult.",Bill Coughran,Sequoia Capital
You try to remain professional and polite about it. Transparent doesn't have to mean abusive.,Bill Coughran,Sequoia Capital
"Some of the work I was involved with at Bell Labs — very core computer systems work — shaped my thinking about how to build large-scale systems and designs for many years, and it’s something that served me well at Google. Because there I had the opportunity to work with some of the largest systems that I think have been built today.",Bill Coughran,Sequoia Capital
"I stayed for 20 years at Bell Labs, and I probably should've left sooner. Even the best places get stale after a while. And you get stale in them. I think it’s healthy to make a change every few years.",Bill Coughran,Sequoia Capital
"People say you can never hire enough engineers. But that’s wrong. Beyond a certain threshold, additional developers slow you down. It’s a byproduct of human nature and organizational dynamics.",Bill Coughran,Sequoia Capital
The best development teams are almost always two to eight great engineers who work in a single room and have no overhead.,Bill Coughran,Sequoia Capital
"Resist regular meetings. They take time away from design and coding, and they kill productivity. Question every one.",Bill Coughran,Sequoia Capital
"Security’s a big interest of mine. The kind of open, consumer-oriented world that we've entered — with lots of devices and apps and so forth — is just an increasingly difficult world in which to secure things.",Bill Coughran,Sequoia Capital
"After my time at Bell Labs, I co-founded Entrisphere in late 2000. That company was acquired by Ericsson, and I joined Google in 2003.",Bill Coughran,Sequoia Capital
The toughest challenge at Google was managing such a broad set of special people. And such a broad set of research and development groups.,Bill Coughran,Sequoia Capital
A small team with good people can steer itself. (Most of the time.),Bill Coughran,Sequoia Capital
"My sense is that it is time to do interesting hardware again. It's a little countercultural to the venture capital community, because I think they've gotten out of the hardware-building mindset. But these things come in cycles.",Bill Coughran,Sequoia Capital
Smartest person I've ever worked with? I think the smartest person I got to know a little bit is Don Knuth. He was a professor at Stanford when I was a graduate student there.,Bill Coughran,Sequoia Capital
"Theater, opera, symphony, that kind of thing. My wife and I both like performance. Those are things that I enjoy.",Bill Coughran,Sequoia Capital
Engineering is easy. People are hard.,Bill Coughran,Sequoia Capital
"All of us look up to these legendary founders, but every one of them started out as an unknown underdog. This was true for the founders of WhatsApp, Carbon, Nimble Storage, AdMob, and Palo Alto Networks and it's true for the seed-stage founder who walks in our door tomorrow.",Jim Goetz,Sequoia Capital
I loved the years I had as an entrepreneur.,Jim Goetz,Sequoia Capital
"What’s really interesting to us is new categories where there is no market. There's no TAM, there's no SAM, and it's all about those early beachhead customers.",Jim Goetz,Sequoia Capital
The common thread through Sequoia’s most legendary founders: Misfits. Unknowns. All focused on personal pain. All willing to put something out early and iterate.,Jim Goetz,Sequoia Capital
"Reinventing the IT stack is the here-and-now opportunity. So whether it's storage, or compute, or software architectures, the post-PC delivery methodology — they're all going to shift.",Jim Goetz,Sequoia Capital
"Enterprise startups — they have one competitor typically, maybe two, and those are the incumbents. They’re large, slow, flat-footed. So it's almost blue-ocean.",Jim Goetz,Sequoia Capital
"Compare that to consumer: The categories that are interesting often have a couple dozen companies, and they’re well-funded. It borders on the Malthusian.",Jim Goetz,Sequoia Capital
"I was raised in the Midwest, studied as an engineer, and gave up on a PhD to start my career as a rookie product manager.",Jim Goetz,Sequoia Capital
"How are you going to build long-term competitive barriers? We’re not comforted by patents, I can tell you that. Patents are fine, but it's more of a defensive tactic.",Jim Goetz,Sequoia Capital
"If you’re an engineer, and I was guilty of this, you love talking about technology. But as an investor it’s more about understanding how that technology or business process creates an unfair advantage.",Jim Goetz,Sequoia Capital
It's very easy to convince yourself that an idea is unique and compelling if you're not intellectually honest.,Jim Goetz,Sequoia Capital
"Probably one in 15 entrepreneurs who walks through our doors can really convey their initial marketing position in under five minutes. If you can get to that stage, boy, are we interested.",Jim Goetz,Sequoia Capital
"We get tingly when we meet with a bunch of engineers who just knocked out some fabulous code. They may not talk a lot in the meeting, but that lends a great deal of credibility.",Jim Goetz,Sequoia Capital
You see these stacked founding teams and — where are the times-ten programmers? Where’s that wonderful architect? Where’s that individual with the fabulous sense of simplicity and market expertise?,Jim Goetz,Sequoia Capital
Pedigree is not important at Sequoia. It’s not part of our criteria.,Jim Goetz,Sequoia Capital
"It’s that team dynamic. The cadence of the weekly, the monthly, the quarterly successes. Competing in the marketplace. Taking the hill together.",Jim Goetz,Sequoia Capital
"Before I joined Sequoia I was a founder, so I know what it’s like to have to learn as you go. My first four companies did not go as well as I hoped. Sequoia invested in my fifth startup, AdMob, while I was still in business school. What I learned from AdMob’s success (and more importantly from the previous four companies), is that the value lies more in the execution than the idea. You can have an idea, but executing it well is what matters. I also learned that product market fit is a visceral feeling—and when it happens, you’ll feel it.",Omar Hamoui,Sequoia Capital
Entrepreneurship is like Battleship. Your failures map out your successful targets later.,Omar Hamoui,Sequoia Capital
"I’d say I’m an entrepreneur with a focus on product and technology. Significant experience in mobile, but with a general interest in consumer internet, as well.",Omar Hamoui,Sequoia Capital
"The phone, in many ways, is the first “thing” in the internet of things. People are asking, “Why can’t you take all the other items in my life and give them these powers that I now expect and understand?”",Omar Hamoui,Sequoia Capital
"We’re dealing with a user base that’s effectively up-leveled. And companies that do what people now know is possible are being rewarded, quickly.",Omar Hamoui,Sequoia Capital
My first job was walking into small businesses and seeing if they needed help with their computers.,Omar Hamoui,Sequoia Capital
"At AdMob we spent a lot of time talking about what was wrong. When people would visit our board meetings I’d have to prepare them ahead of time, basically saying, “Don’t worry. The company’s not falling apart. This is just how we are.”",Omar Hamoui,Sequoia Capital
You can just be a lot more productive if you spend time on the things that aren’t going well.,Omar Hamoui,Sequoia Capital
Avoid arrogance at all costs.,Omar Hamoui,Sequoia Capital
"If you go to business school — or probably any professional school — with these highly motivated people, they’re stressed out of their minds. As if they’re going to be homeless if they don’t get an internship in the summer.",Omar Hamoui,Sequoia Capital
"People just greatly miscalculate risk, in my opinion. They’re too afraid of things.",Omar Hamoui,Sequoia Capital
So many times I was sure something was going to work and it hit the market and fell flat.,Omar Hamoui,Sequoia Capital
"If you can find someone who isn’t afraid to tell you you’re an idiot, and who really brightens your day when they give you some positive feedback, keep that person nearby.",Omar Hamoui,Sequoia Capital
"I speak English, Arabic and Spanish. Un poquito.",Omar Hamoui,Sequoia Capital
"Young entrepreneurs hear all this celebration of people who are difficult to work with and think, “Jeez, maybe I'm not doing this right. I need to be more aggressive, I need to be more rude.”",Omar Hamoui,Sequoia Capital
"At the end of the day, business is a transaction between people. And just being a decent human being goes a long way.",Omar Hamoui,Sequoia Capital
"If you have to constantly look at what your competition is doing in order to guide your next step, you’re not an entrepreneur. You’re an opportunist.",Omar Hamoui,Sequoia Capital
"My son was born nine weeks early and weighed three pounds at birth. Holding something so important, but so fragile, was the scariest thing I’ve ever experienced. Thankfully he did great after that and it all turned out wonderfully.",Omar Hamoui,Sequoia Capital
When things are going well you can always raise more money or hire more people. Your most limited resource is time.,Omar Hamoui,Sequoia Capital
"I moved to Silicon Valley after graduate school, with pretty much just two suitcases and the ambition to start a company.",Aaref Hilaly,Sequoia Capital
The first lesson I learned is never to lose peripheral vision for unexpected opportunity. Nothing worked out as I planned.,Aaref Hilaly,Sequoia Capital
Both my companies were funded by Sequoia within a year of being founded. It really helped to partner early. Talking to Mike Moritz and Jim Goetz each week helped me grow from being a terrified founder into a confident CEO. I joined Sequoia with the goal of helping other founders in the same way.,Aaref Hilaly,Sequoia Capital
"I’m originally from Pakistan and grew up in England. Neither of my parents went to college, and I was very lucky to get scholarships and grants to attend great schools. Being among such talented people was eye-opening, and it raised my own level of aspiration. It also convinced me not to follow a conventional path – I never shook the feeling of being an outsider.",Aaref Hilaly,Sequoia Capital
"Once, at CenterRun, we’d just missed our sales target by a mile. I had to break the news to my investors and probably lay off 25% of our staff. The first person I went to see was Mike Moritz.",Aaref Hilaly,Sequoia Capital
"Mike was silent for a moment, and then asked if I’d seen the movie Apocalypse Now. He explained the scene where Robert Duval takes his men surfing on the Nung River under napalm strikes and enemy fire. Mike said, “You need to go surfing. The company needs to see you surfing right now.” It took me a minute to understand the wisdom of what he was saying. My team needed to see that I still believed.",Aaref Hilaly,Sequoia Capital
"At Clearwell, we hit product-market fit, grew from almost zero to a $100m revenue run-rate in four years, became profitable — but the fear and paranoia never went away. It still felt like the company was balanced on a knife’s edge.",Aaref Hilaly,Sequoia Capital
"My team used to look forward to board meetings. Jim Goetz pushed our thinking. He looked at things in a different way and showed us that board meetings are for the company to learn, not for the founders to report. I try to do the same as a board member today.",Aaref Hilaly,Sequoia Capital
"One thing people often forget is that we love the early stages of company building. It’s how I worked with Sequoia as an entrepreneur, and what I look for as an investor. Most companies we work with are at the seed or Series A stage. ",Aaref Hilaly,Sequoia Capital
"We like to dream with the entrepreneur, to imagine the world as they see it, and then ask ourselves how we can help.",Aaref Hilaly,Sequoia Capital
"Tell a story. We only partner with about a dozen new companies each year and we’re drawn to those with a clear, compelling narrative.",Aaref Hilaly,Sequoia Capital
"I love the early days: small teams with unique and clear insight about the future. Often there are raw edges, and much is not yet figured out. Partnering closely with these early teams to help realize their long term ambitions is the great pleasure of our business.",Matt Huang,Sequoia Capital
"One of my good friends from MIT dropped out to join Dropbox when the team was just a handful of people. At the time, I had little awareness of Dropbox, Y Combinator or startups in general, much less any appreciation for why one would drop out of school. That was kind of a wakeup call. ",Matt Huang,Sequoia Capital
"I chose to go to MIT to study math, but I also spent as much time as possible in the computer science and economics departments. In retrospect, I would have shifted the weighting more toward computer science, but training in math has turned out to be a surprisingly helpful tool for better thinking.",Matt Huang,Sequoia Capital
Junior year I started hacking on projects with a couple of classmates. Eventually our efforts evolved into a company called Hotspots - funded by Y Combinator and other angels - where our focus was on building analytics tools for streaming data.,Matt Huang,Sequoia Capital
"Hotspots was acquired by Twitter in 2012, and we spent the next couple of years building analytics for Twitter ads. It was a fascinating experience to see the company scale from about a hundred million to billions in revenue and an IPO. ",Matt Huang,Sequoia Capital
"In general, I’m highly skeptical of what’s popular. It’s an automatic response that is not always productive, but overall I’ve found it to be helpful as the seed for independent thought. ",Matt Huang,Sequoia Capital
"In many ways, venture capitalists are the gatekeepers to funding. As an immigrant and the oldest of three girls, I care deeply about widening those gates and equalizing access to opportunity. ",Liu Jiang,Sequoia Capital
"In high school, I spent part of my summer at the World Bank working on their open data initiative and their mobile app. I witnessed how data-driven governments spurred economic innovation and how mobile devices enabled civilians’ financial independence.",Liu Jiang,Sequoia Capital
"I studied computer science, electrical engineering, and management engineering at Stanford. I enjoy decomposing systems - whether they’re software, hardware, or organizations - and analyzing the interdependencies among their components. ",Liu Jiang,Sequoia Capital
"My Dropbox experience convinced me that as with web and mobile, every successful company will eventually have an AI strategy. Technology is extending from bits to atoms, and AI is already augmenting or replacing physical world functions.   ",Liu Jiang,Sequoia Capital
"I’m also intrigued by companies that are reinventing large industries, such as healthcare, financial services, logistics, manufacturing, and real estate. Many of these industries have yet to capitalize on the potential of data and analytics. ",Liu Jiang,Sequoia Capital
"I spend much of my free time tinkering with frontier tech. Some of my projects include 3D printing robot arms, editing bacterial genomes, programming crypto wallets, developing AR apps for the Hololens, designing autonomous car displays, and conducting computer vision and NLP research.",Liu Jiang,Sequoia Capital
"Thanks to some travel hacks, I've explored over 50 countries, many of them solo. When you’re journeying alone where no one knows you, you’re more introspective and honest with yourself. Each discovery is your own, and you embrace getting lost in the right (or wrong) direction. ",Liu Jiang,Sequoia Capital
"As a long distance runner, I find that summoning the resolve to get started is the hardest part; the rest is just dogged persistence. ",Liu Jiang,Sequoia Capital
"Our meetings center around exchanges of ideas rather than one-sided Q&As. It’s easy to use logic and be a skeptic, but I try to understand a founder’s vision and dream with her. ",Liu Jiang,Sequoia Capital
"We love getting to know founders early on, and the strongest relationships are built outside of a formal fundraising process. If you’re hesitating to reach out to us, just do it. The answer is always no when you don’t ask. ",Liu Jiang,Sequoia Capital
You need grit to get through the entrepreneurial journey. Startups are a roller coaster of ups & downs.,Jess Lee,Sequoia Capital
I’ve been on that roller coaster. And I think being there for an entrepreneur during those tough times can be one of my strengths.,Jess Lee,Sequoia Capital
"The best consumer companies reinvent the way we live. The art is in understanding the user, creating a kernel of delight, and having the resilience to ride out the storms.  Consumers can be fickle — in love with a service one day and over it the next. It's a tough space that requires a founder with a lot of grit. ",Jess Lee,Sequoia Capital
"Growing up I wanted to be a comic book artist. I told my parents, “I’m going to be a graphic novelist.” But they’re Asian, so they said no and refused to pay for art school.",Jess Lee,Sequoia Capital
I got to Stanford and took my first computer science class. I just fell in love. ,Jess Lee,Sequoia Capital
I’m very transparent. I can’t help but say what I’m thinking. ,Jess Lee,Sequoia Capital
"I originally planned to be an engineer — I had actually already signed an offer — and then I got the call to go and interview at Google for the Associate Product Manager program. And I remember thinking, “I want to be just like these people.”",Jess Lee,Sequoia Capital
"My first boss was Marissa Mayer. She built the Associate Product Manager program at Google and I was in the third class of APMs. I was there four years as a PM on Google Maps, and I learned a lot. ",Jess Lee,Sequoia Capital
"Then one day someone showed me Polyvore. I was just an early user who fell in love with it. I wrote an email with some suggestions and ended up as Polyvore’s first PM. Eventually I became VP of Product, then CEO.",Jess Lee,Sequoia Capital
"Somewhere along the way the other founders came to me and said, “We’ve always thought of you as a cofounder, so we’ll just call you an honorary cofounder from now on.” What an amazing and generous thing to do. It’s always meant a lot to me.",Jess Lee,Sequoia Capital
"As a CEO, I think I was good at two things. One was culture: building a culture where the team felt really empowered. Then on the product side, I’d say I had a strong sense of user empathy and some UI design sensibilities. ",Jess Lee,Sequoia Capital
"We eventually sold to Yahoo. I was really happy — we’d brought the team on this crazy journey of ups and downs, and we made it. It was a great outcome.",Jess Lee,Sequoia Capital
"Startups are really hard. I know that from personal experience. A million variables have to line up for things to work out, and sometimes it feels like everything that could have gone wrong is going wrong. ",Jess Lee,Sequoia Capital
"I met Roelof in 2012 and he said, “Hey, maybe you should come and be a VC sometime.” And I said, “Noooo…I would never do that. I’m a company builder, I’m a team leader, I want to do it with my own two hands.”",Jess Lee,Sequoia Capital
"But the idea of leveraging what I learned over eight and a half years of toiling — and it really was blood, sweat and tears — to help other entrepreneurs? That’s really exciting to me. ",Jess Lee,Sequoia Capital
I’m personally interested in AR and VR. I think those are the next big platforms post-mobile.,Jess Lee,Sequoia Capital
"In my first interview with Marissa she told me, whenever she’d had to choose between two paths, she always tried to pick the more challenging one. And that advice has stayed with me. It drove me to go to Polyvore when I was happy at Google. It drove me to be CEO when I was VP of Product. It drove me here, right? ",Jess Lee,Sequoia Capital
Challenge yourself.,Jess Lee,Sequoia Capital
"I don’t think I quite fit the traditional mould for what a CEO is supposed to be like. Personality-wise, a certain set of skills, being introverted — none of those things are your classic CEO. Figuring out how to lead in my own style, authentically, has shaped me tremendously.",Jess Lee,Sequoia Capital
"The strength of an introvert is that, if you don’t like the spotlight on yourself, you put it naturally on your team. ",Jess Lee,Sequoia Capital
Do a few things well. No one is good at everything. You have to figure out the one thing you’re really good at and just work your ass off.,Jess Lee,Sequoia Capital
"Maybe because of my upbringing — I’m an immigrant from Italy, I actually came on a boat at the age of 11 — there’s something to be said for the feeling of desperation and the feeling you have no choice but to win.",Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
"The old adage that, “if it ain't broke, don't fix it,” does not apply to Sequoia Capital. It’s the exact opposite. If something is working like a dream, we modify it, we try to break it, because competitors and new entrants will try to find new ways to beat us.",Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
"When we first met the team at Meraki, it was clear that the founders and the product were exceptional, but the market they were planning to chase was not. We spent the first two years exploring four different markets until we found the one that worked. Their early days were not easy and the company struggled. Eventually, when they zeroed in on the appropriate market opportunity, revenues skyrocketed. ",Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
There are exactly zero successful founders who weren’t insistent on doing things their own way.,Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
"Great founders listen to all points of view and then march down whichever path they deem most productive. They can be irreverent and stubborn, but that’s not a bad thing. Placating them when we disagree is. It’s OK to have a spirited conversation based on facts and not emotions…and in the end, it is the founder who decides the path. ",Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
"None of the companies where I serve on the board are “Doug Leone companies.” They are Sequoia Capital companies. We work as a team. A founder has not just Doug Leone or Jim Goetz on the board, but all of Sequoia Capital.",Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
"When I meet an entrepreneur who’s considering partnering with us, I tell her that I’m not a founder’s friend. I am a founder’s business partner. My job is to do everything in my power to help make her and her company enormously successful. I’ll work 24/7 to help realize the full potential of her idea.  We will likely become good friends over time.",Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
"If a founder wants a nodding bobble head, we’re the wrong partners, and I am certainly the wrong board member.",Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
"Hire people who think from first principles. If you have a playbook written in indelible ink, or if you know the answer before the question is asked, you are not for us.",Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
"Choose to have kids or not. But if you choose to have kids, invest in your kids. That is the most important thing you can do in your life.",Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
"My first job in sales was selling north of 96th Street in New York City. Now it's cool to be north of 96th Street. Let me tell you, in 1979 it was not safe to be north of 96th Street. But that location had Columbia University, where someone explained to me what the ARPANET was. And that eventually led to a job at Sun Microsystems.",Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
"If you pitch to Sequoia, just describe clearly your vision, your product, and the business around your product. Remember, you are selling shares, not selling just product. We don’t need a balance sheet for the year 2020.",Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
"Crystal-clear thinking is one of the things we look for. Not a fancy slide pitch, but crystal-clear thinking.",Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
Avoid pontificating board members with nothing to say.,Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
"Sequoia looks for people from humble backgrounds. Maybe something happened in our lives early on, our system was shocked, and we have this unbelievable need to stay on top and to succeed.",Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
It’s why I get up at 4:30 every morning to work out. I want to make sure I don’t lose an inch on the edge front. ,Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
"Make no mistake: We want to be the very first penny of capital into young companies for the simple reason that we want to be their business partner from day one. We know from experience over many, many years that the DNA of a company is often set in the first 30, 60, or 90 days.",Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
"Make sure you have a partner who has experience, bandwidth, and tells it like it is.  The last thing a founder needs is to have to figure out what his board member actually means.  ",Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
"A great investor partner completely appreciates how difficult the life of a founder is, and he should do everything in his power to help him succeed. Adding stress is not helpful.",Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
"Venture is quite a competitive business. Everybody is saying exactly the same things, but only a few firms are able to deliver for portfolio companies.",Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
"Next time you hear from an investor that he’s “founder-friendly” as part of his sales approach, you may want to raise your antenna in the same way you would when a stranger starts calling you “buddy” a few minutes after he meets you. It’s a marketing tagline meant to disarm you.",Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
"If you come to present at Sequoia there are no phones out, no one looking at email, the meetings start on time. We try to treat people the way we would treat someone in our living room. Because we completely understand the pressure you’re under when you come to see us. We take that presentation and the conversation that follows quite seriously.  We don’t expect you to have all your facts buttoned up.  We have partnered with numerous founders at the very earliest stages of their company.",Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
We don't have flower children here. We will ask questions if we have them.,Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
I hate talking about the past. The one thing you should know about me is that I rarely take photographs. Because I’m afraid that photographs tie me back to the past.,Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
We're paranoid as heck. We're always one or two decisions away from becoming a second-tier firm. And that is very clear in our minds.,Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
"We have a heterogeneous set of talents at Sequoia. We have engineers, sales, marketing, finance, Italians, Chinese, Indians. But we would benefit by having more women on our investment team.",Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
The founders and management teams do 99% of the work. They’re the ones who should be in the limelight.,Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
I have no idea what’s hot. But I’m certainly always listening. Big Dumbo ears. Just listening.,Doug Leone,Sequoia Capital
I’m an operator. I’ve been fortunate enough to help scale three companies from the founding stages to profitable businesses and through successful acquisitions.,Alfred Lin,Sequoia Capital
"I joined Sequoia because I had worked with Sequoia partners for a long time as an operator, and almost all Sequoia partners have worked at, started, and been part of the management team at companies that have done extraordinary things. ",Alfred Lin,Sequoia Capital
"Airbnb started with an air mattress and a radical vision of what hospitality could mean. As the seed investor, Sequoia partnered with Airbnb before it was clear to all that they could design trust among strangers, making a better way to travel and creating a way for people everywhere to belong anywhere.",Alfred Lin,Sequoia Capital
"If your goal is to get straight As and never speed, you're probably not cut out to disrupt an industry, which requires original thinking, an ability to see the world differently from others, and courage to challenge conventional wisdom when it doesn't make sense.  (This is not saying you should be lazy, get Cs, intentionally do bad things, break the law, and challenge conventional wisdom for just the sake of it.)",Alfred Lin,Sequoia Capital
A tall tale about one of my college jobs was buying whole pizzas and selling them by the slice to my roommates at Harvard. It wasn't predatory — honest.,Alfred Lin,Sequoia Capital
"When I was contemplating going to business school after LinkExchange was sold to Microsoft, Michael Moritz (who graduated from Wharton, but never includes it in his bio) told me, “You learn more in three months at a startup than at business school.”  I've been working at or with startups ever since.",Alfred Lin,Sequoia Capital
"When I was in a PhD program in statistics, Tony [Hsieh] would say that must be like watching paint dry, in the dark, as part of his way to recruit me into LinkExchange. I would laugh at that because, while I love math and numbers, I also had a passion for business. Dropping out was a hard conversation with my traditional Taiwanese parents.",Alfred Lin,Sequoia Capital
"I've been on both sides of being an operator and an investor, and I think it’s a privilege to have been on both sides.",Alfred Lin,Sequoia Capital
"I remember pitching Sequoia when I was at LinkExchange, at Tellme, at Zappos, so I can relate that fundraising is a pain.",Alfred Lin,Sequoia Capital
"The thing that culture, customer service, and fitness all have in common is that if you don't make it a daily habit, it's not going to be your core competency. Focusing on culture or customer service when it is already bad is similar to going on a crash diet and working out only when you notice when you are out of shape.",Alfred Lin,Sequoia Capital
"The 80/20 rule doesn't apply to entrepreneurship. Since the vast majority of companies fail, you don’t get rewarded unless you are above the 99.9th percentile.",Alfred Lin,Sequoia Capital
"Those charts that show exponential growth, if you narrow it down to the very early beginnings, it looks quite flat. It takes a long time to get the flywheel going. So don't be discouraged.",Alfred Lin,Sequoia Capital
Think about all the people that you've never liked working with. What values do they have? Think of the opposite of that. Maybe those should be considered values for your company. ,Alfred Lin,Sequoia Capital
"At Sequoia, we don’t want to be treated any differently than your co-founder or your management team. We want to be there in the trenches with you, and be able to discuss any problem you have.  We pride ourselves on being the first call you make when you want unconventional and prescient advice.",Alfred Lin,Sequoia Capital
"Who’s going to be your worst reference and why? I like asking that question just to see how introspective and brutally honest you are about yourself. If you can’t be transparent about that, we haven’t established the right level of trust yet to be business partners.",Alfred Lin,Sequoia Capital
By training I’m an applied mathematician and statistician. I can definitely geek out on bootstrapping statistics as well as companies.,Alfred Lin,Sequoia Capital
"My earliest computing memory is an abacus — which I could never use, despite my dad being the number two abacus champion in Taiwan.",Alfred Lin,Sequoia Capital
"My parents emigrated to the United States because they wanted a better life for me and my brother. We went from middle class to poor in that move, but my parents told us that we were temporarily poor. At the age of six, I didn't understand what they were trying to tell me.  Today, I know the most valuable lesson from my parents was not that the US necessarily provides for a better life, it was that if you are intellectually curious, goal oriented, and work hard, you will figure things out. ",Alfred Lin,Sequoia Capital
"In some ways you should ignore the climate. If you love what you're doing, you’re going to love it during good or bad times. ",Alfred Lin,Sequoia Capital
I didn't think raising too much money could be a bad thing until I saw how easy it is for once disciplined founders to blow through money when they start thinking certain things are not “worth” their time.,Alfred Lin,Sequoia Capital
"Raising a very large round might be a good vanity metric, but it rarely leads to great operating businesses.",Alfred Lin,Sequoia Capital
"People date for many years before they get married, and half of those partnerships still end in divorce. Why would relationships on the business side be any different? I would spend more time getting to know people before you let them invest in your company. Because if things go well, it's a five, ten, fifteen-year journey.",Alfred Lin,Sequoia Capital
"To this day my mother still asks me, “When are you going to go back and finish your PhD?” It’s unlikely.",Alfred Lin,Sequoia Capital
"If you look at our most successful partnerships, the founders started the company, built the company, and are at the helm.",Michael Moritz,Sequoia Capital
"When we first get involved with a tiny company, nothing is obvious. If you’re looking for certainty you wind up with boring people engaged in mundane activities. We have a fondness for obsessives on a mission. This was the case when we met the founders of what would become Google, Stripe, Yahoo, and PayPal and we hope it’s true when we meet you.",Michael Moritz,Sequoia Capital
I wouldn’t be here today if not for the generosity of strangers.,Michael Moritz,Sequoia Capital
"When I started at Sequoia Capital, there was no way we could have considered helping form companies addressing financial services, media, advertising, entertainment, or personalized medicine. But technology has seeped into every crevice of the economy.",Michael Moritz,Sequoia Capital
"If we encountered someone like Larry Page or Steve Jobs every five years, we'd be on the tips of our toes with excitement.",Michael Moritz,Sequoia Capital
"Many kids I went to school with, their dads were unemployed or had part time work. Many of them didn’t have very much money. This was Britain in the early 1970s when there were gas strikes and coal strikes. It was pretty bleak and miserable.",Michael Moritz,Sequoia Capital
Growing up in Wales made you understand what being an outsider is like.,Michael Moritz,Sequoia Capital
"Everyone at Sequoia Capital works in the same open space so we can see each other, gossip mindlessly and hurl choice epithets when appropriate.",Michael Moritz,Sequoia Capital
"Few markets are as ferociously competitive as the technology business in China. People there simply work a lot harder. And when you ally that with talent, creativity and a hunger to succeed, it’s a formidable concoction.",Michael Moritz,Sequoia Capital
"In China these days, there are probably four Silicon Valleys. In the US, there’s one.",Michael Moritz,Sequoia Capital
I came to America in 1976 without actually knowing anyone here. No grand plan whatsoever. And one thing led to another. I wound up as a correspondent for Time Magazine and was transferred to San Francisco.,Michael Moritz,Sequoia Capital
"At the time all I knew was that California was the leftmost part of America, and after that you fell off into the water.",Michael Moritz,Sequoia Capital
America was built on immigrants. Today it’s impossible to satisfy Silicon Valley's appetite for engineers and scientists with people born here.,Michael Moritz,Sequoia Capital
"On the whole, we really dislike it when founders sell their company.",Michael Moritz,Sequoia Capital
We're looking for people who are at the beginning of a great pursuit that they think will account for pretty much every waking moment of their foreseeable future. And who are following a deeply ingrained interest that they're ready to proselytize to the world.,Michael Moritz,Sequoia Capital
"Founding a company is the hardest act in business, and people who haven't done it don't really understand.",Michael Moritz,Sequoia Capital
It’s fortunate that most large companies ignore or underestimate startups because otherwise even fewer would succeed and we would not have a business.,Michael Moritz,Sequoia Capital
"I wish I’d carved out time each day to, at a minimum, draw. The diversion and the tactile sensation of making something that hasn’t existed before buoys the spirits.",Michael Moritz,Sequoia Capital
Picking up a paintbrush in middle-age is not for the faint of heart.,Michael Moritz,Sequoia Capital
The people who know us well really like being in business with us. We’ve worked multiple times with the same people and we always invite founders to simply talk with all the people we’ve been in business with and make up their own minds.,Michael Moritz,Sequoia Capital
"If you can’t say to a buddy of yours that having us as a partner was one of the very best decisions of your business life, then we’ve failed you.",Michael Moritz,Sequoia Capital
"The Ball is Round. For those interested in the history of football, sometimes called soccer, this book is the first and last word.",Michael Moritz,Sequoia Capital
"I derive great fulfillment from helping others achieve their full potential. I’m obsessed with technology and building companies. I feel lucky to have discovered the best role for me, and that’s a supporting role, behind the scenes, for the greatest founders, teams, and companies of tomorrow.",Bryan Schreier,Sequoia Capital
"You will not find me at conferences. I do not write blog posts. I avoid “humble” self-promotion on Twitter and Facebook. It’s not about me. This behavior is part focus and part allergy. Don’t get me wrong — I love working with people. That is what gets me up in the morning. It is what I do. However, anything that is more than a degree away from supporting a company or founder feels like misused time.",Bryan Schreier,Sequoia Capital
"We met Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi in a tiny Russian Hill apartment in 2007. In addition to being the founders of Dropbox, they were also the only employees. All it took was an introduction and a pre-launch demo to make it clear to us that they had both the vision and the skills to become the center of peoples' digital world.",Bryan Schreier,Sequoia Capital
This might sound over the top. It isn’t. My goal is to be the founder’s first call. This is not something an investor can add to a term sheet. It has to be earned through trust and delivery. And it is definitely not glamorous.,Bryan Schreier,Sequoia Capital
"Building companies is messy. I’m normally involved in the ugly parts of company development — not the nifty, glamorous ones.",Bryan Schreier,Sequoia Capital
Most of my learned behavior comes from early on. My father sacrificed his career to give me the gift of education — because he thought I had potential. The high school he sent me to developed my sense of service to others.,Bryan Schreier,Sequoia Capital
I appreciate the alignment in our business - we win by helping our companies win.  The only thing better than winning is seeing Sequoia companies win.,Bryan Schreier,Sequoia Capital
"I’ve never run a real company but I learned from one of the great leaders of our time. She taught me how to take a team from zero to thousands, and how to creatively address any challenge thrown in front of me. She also taught me about loyalty beyond loyalty, and how to fight for your people. I built my practice on that foundation.",Bryan Schreier,Sequoia Capital
"In business, my people are my founders and my partners.",Bryan Schreier,Sequoia Capital
"You’ll be able to find the other stuff you need to know about me through the founders I work with and maybe a bit of Twittering. That said, it really is pretty simple: I thrive on partnering with people who will make a dent in tomorrow — and being there for whatever they need to maximize that dent.",Bryan Schreier,Sequoia Capital
Children grow up thinking they can do anything. Life slowly teaches you all the things you supposedly can’t do. It’s why most of the truly great companies are founded by really young entrepreneurs. They haven’t yet learned what they can’t do.,Mike Vernal,Sequoia Capital
The best founders are relentless learners. We saw this with Patrick and John when we first met Stripe - there were only 3 employees when we partnered with them. A small team of people with vision and drive can change the world.  ,Mike Vernal,Sequoia Capital
"Don’t play by someone else’s rules. The very best entrepreneurs don’t chase an existing competitor or market. They create their own game with its own rules and, in the process, create a whole new market.",Mike Vernal,Sequoia Capital
"The best consumer products tend to do one thing really, really well. Once you figure out what that is, just keep making it better and better. Resist the temptation to prematurely add more features.",Mike Vernal,Sequoia Capital
"When I was 11 years old, I won a trip for my family and me to Denmark. There was a contest at a toy store to guess the number of pieces in a giant Lego Christmas display. I think I was off by seven.",Mike Vernal,Sequoia Capital
Don’t mistake motion for progress. It was one of my favorite sayings at Facebook. I’ve seen a lot of talented achievers confuse being busy with actually doing something important. Find the small number of things that really matter and focus all your energy on them.,Mike Vernal,Sequoia Capital
"When I first graduated from college, I thought you were supposed to design novel, thoughtful, elegant solutions to problems. I eventually learned to just find the quickest, simplest solution and move on to the next problem. Done is better than perfect.",Mike Vernal,Sequoia Capital
"Hire for slope, not y-intercept. If you’re a fast-growing startup, you need people who can scale with the company. Hire people who have shown they can grow quickly, rather than people with lots of experience but slow growth curves.",Mike Vernal,Sequoia Capital
"I started out believing that you could build a great developer platform and let someone else build the killer app. When that didn’t work, I figured you had to build both at the same time. I finally realized that great platforms evolve out of killer apps.",Mike Vernal,Sequoia Capital
"In consumer, the best product leaders are students of human nature. They think about how a product makes people feel and how those emotions propagate through the network.",Mike Vernal,Sequoia Capital
"My first computer program was a 50,000-line version of Battleship in Pascal, complete with ASCII animations when the ships sank. When I learned that you could define your own functions, it got a lot shorter.",Mike Vernal,Sequoia Capital
"Creating value is not enough. To build a great company, you need to make sure you can capture some of the value you create. Most early technologists don’t pay enough attention to how they’re going to sustainably capture value.",Mike Vernal,Sequoia Capital
"My favorite class in college was CS161 (Operating Systems). Each assignment involved writing a huge chunk of the operating system – the memory manager, the file system, etc. It was the best possible training for understanding how computers really work.",Mike Vernal,Sequoia Capital
"I grew up in a tiny apartment outside New York City. One day when I was 5, my oldest brother told me to stand between two chairs and started shooting hockey pucks at me. Thus began my 15-year career as a goalie. Eventually someone bought me a helmet.",Mike Vernal,Sequoia Capital
I love partnering with thoughtful visionaries who have the grit to turn their dreams into reality.,Stephanie Zhan,Sequoia Capital
"I remember my first chat with Against Gravity. Listening to the team’s vision was a magical peek into VR as a promising computing platform, and inspired us to dream about the future of communication and collaboration. We led the seed just 3 weeks post-launch. ",Stephanie Zhan,Sequoia Capital
I’m a big believer in the saying that you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. Choose your partners thoughtfully.,Stephanie Zhan,Sequoia Capital
"Growing up in Beijing and Hong Kong, I watched technology facilitate rapid economic development from WeChat as a new OS, to the electric bicycle revolution. Living in a state of constant change has made me crave continuous innovation.",Stephanie Zhan,Sequoia Capital
"As a competitive swimmer, I learned early to never become complacent. When your main competition is the clock, you can always do better. I live by this philosophy.",Stephanie Zhan,Sequoia Capital

"And I don't think people appreciate that it’s a team game here at Sequoia. Really, it is.",Michael Dixon,Sequoia Capital
"I joined Sequoia in 2008. It was a totally different interview than any I'd ever had. I met Doug in Boston and he didn’t care at all about, “OK, you got good grades.” He cared about why. What did my parents do? What drove me? ",Michael Dixon,Sequoia Capital
"My first thought when I got here was, “How would I ever fit in with a group of people this smart?” I still think about that a lot.",Michael Dixon,Sequoia Capital
"Changing payment models, policy, the consumerization of healthcare — there are these big, tectonic plate shifts happening. From a regulation point of view but also scientifically. And it’s still 20% of GDP. ",Michael Dixon,Sequoia Capital

I just like listening to sports talk radio.,Michael Dixon,Sequoia Capital
"We try to have this attitude at Sequoia when we're on the board of a company that, if things are going poorly, you take your foot off the accelerator. And if things are going great, you sort of pound it. ",Michael Dixon,Sequoia Capital

"If you choose me as your partner, you're not choosing me. You're choosing us.",Michael Dixon,Sequoia Capital
"Founders want to be involved with specific partners because that's who's going to be at your board meeting, but there's a lot of interaction that goes on between board meetings over the lifetime of a partnership. And that involves all of us in the building.",Michael Dixon,Sequoia Capital
"With Percolate, that’s been an eye-opener for me — what’s happening on the brand side. And the idea that brands are going to finally take back some ownership of everything they’ve outsourced to agencies.",Michael Dixon,Sequoia Capital

Wrestling in high school taught me a lot. I learned self-discipline and to push myself to achieve my personal best while also being a team player.,Carl Eschenbach,Sequoia Capital
"I’ve been part of two very successful startups, VMware and Inktomi. I’ve also had the opportunity to meet with dozens of startups over the last decade.",Carl Eschenbach,Sequoia Capital

"Every day we sit with some of the smartest people in the world, and they tell us what the future holds.",Pat Grady,Sequoia Capital
"My dad always said “when your values are clear, decision-making is easy.” He was right. Founders who are crystal clear on what they care about, and why, create cultures in which decisions are made quickly and correctly.",Pat Grady,Sequoia Capital
I used to think that culture was a very fluffy thing that people talked about when they didn't have anything better to say. Boy was I wrong. Culture is everything. It's the most scalable system you have.,Pat Grady,Sequoia Capital
"Culture and vision are the two essential roles of a founder. You can hire for any aspect of a business, but culture and vision are fundamental. They determine who you are, and why you exist. That can't come from the outside.",Pat Grady,Sequoia Capital
The investors we hire and the founders we back are the same in one important regard: they have a desperate need to win.,Pat Grady,Sequoia Capital
"People at Sequoia have very different backgrounds & very different views of the world, but we work well together because we all care deeply about one thing: helping founders make a dent in the universe.",Pat Grady,Sequoia Capital
"We tend to make about one investment per person per year. We could make a lot more investments, but constraint forces clarity. Instead of thinking, “Will this investment make money?” we have to think, “Does this company have a chance to be truly special?”",Pat Grady,Sequoia Capital
"Don could have started Valentine Ventures, but he named it Sequoia for a reason. He wanted to build something that would endure. Individuals come and go, but a team with a cohesive culture can endure.",Pat Grady,Sequoia Capital

"Most people don't realize where our money comes from. The majority comes from universities, foundations, and other nonprofits. If we screw up, they lose out on scholarships and cancer research. Now that's motivation.",Pat Grady,Sequoia Capital
"That probably sounds like BS, but it's something we really care about. I didn't know it at the time, but my scholarship to Boston College was funded, in part, by proceeds from Sequoia investments. Our returns make a real impact, and we have the tremendous privilege of working for some of the best causes on the planet.",Pat Grady,Sequoia Capital
"In high school and the first part of college, I was a roofer during the summer. Try making $9 an hour putting down T-Lock shingles in 110-degree heat. Studying for midterms in an air-conditioned library is paradise by comparison.",Pat Grady,Sequoia Capital

"Frank Slootman taught us to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. The world changes quickly. Your competitors are trying to kill you. If you relax, you’re dead. We believe that about our own business.",Pat Grady,Sequoia Capital
"Growth creates stress. Great companies are broken in a hundred different ways, but they keep the pressure on. Losing creates stress too. You'd rather have the stress of winning than the stress of losing.",Pat Grady,Sequoia Capital
"Human beings are emotional creatures that occasionally use reason, not rational creatures that occasionally feel. Logic is beautiful, but life is shades of grey. It took me a long time to appreciate that. Doug and Jim probably deserve credit for teaching me that.",Pat Grady,Sequoia Capital
"Every founder deserves a tremendous amount of respect for having the courage to start something. To become completely vulnerable. To ignore reason in pursuit of a dream. I've never had the guts to do that. It's an honor to be your wingman, and it's a responsibility we don't take lightly.",Pat Grady,Sequoia Capital
"We get to work with the world's brightest entrepreneurs building companies that are changing the world. It is humbling, awe-inspiring and incredibly motivating. I love every minute of it.",Matthew Miller,Sequoia Capital
"My passion for technology began as a kid. My parents wouldn't let me play video games unless I built my own computer. So I bought a book, mowed lawns to earn the money for parts, and I built my first computer when I was 11 years old. I started writing software soon after, and never looked back.",Matthew Miller,Sequoia Capital
"Microservices represent the biggest disruption we have seen in enterprise technology in this decade. Akin to the transformation that came to applications due to SaaS, microservices will reinvent every layer of the infrastructure stack.",Matthew Miller,Sequoia Capital
The security model in the enterprise must fundamentally change.  Every company will be breached. How do we live in a world where that will consistently be reality?,Matthew Miller,Sequoia Capital
"Infrastructure software is all becoming open source. It is a far more powerful development model, distribution model and, for users, adoption model. Companies who can develop innovative business models in open source will be rewarded.",Matthew Miller,Sequoia Capital
"We are motivated by the people we represent. I am proud that the majority of our LP capital comes from universities, non-profits and foundations. We measure ourselves by things like the number of scholarships our limited partners provide.",Matthew Miller,Sequoia Capital
"Some companies say, “I don't want to talk to Sequoia because I don't think I'm interesting enough.” It’s the biggest fallacy I run into. ",Matthew Miller,Sequoia Capital

I view part of my job as to fight like hell to give every Sequoia company every unfair advantage we can muster.,Matthew Miller,Sequoia Capital
"One day in college, on a miserable blind date at a chain restaurant, I came up with a business idea to build a restaurant media network. Won our school’s business plan competition, raised a million bucks, and took two years off school to pursue it. Ended up failing miserably. I learned a lot from that experience.",Matthew Miller,Sequoia Capital
The lessons you learn from being an entrepreneur are invaluable.,Matthew Miller,Sequoia Capital
"After school I had a chip on my shoulder that BYU wasn't going to be good enough to get me into the best companies. I wanted real experience across a lot of technology companies. I cold-called Goldman Sachs, got an interview in New York and said, “I will be your best guy if you give me a shot and let me work in the valley.” I got the job and worked 100+ hours a week to deliver on that promise.",Matthew Miller,Sequoia Capital
I wish I could tell my younger self to take more risk. Even after the failed startup. ,Matthew Miller,Sequoia Capital

"The caliber of the founders that cross our threshold every day is truly staggering. Not only in their intellect, but also in their grit.",Andrew Reed,Sequoia Capital
"Nobody can predict the future. It’s important to have a certain self-awareness, an understanding of the limitations of our thinking. The realization that the happenings of yesteryear don’t necessarily foretell what’s next.",Andrew Reed,Sequoia Capital
"One of my majors in college was Classics. Latin and Greek language and literature. I worked for a bit doing manual labor on an archeological dig in Greece. I wish I could say that my experience there somehow translates, but what it really taught me is that Indiana Jones is decidedly fiction.",Andrew Reed,Sequoia Capital
"The quintessential classical hero is Aeneas. He’s the embodiment of perseverance — that there are many ways the wind can blow you, but you can’t lose focus.",Andrew Reed,Sequoia Capital
"The consumerization of the enterprise is largely a failed promise to date, and it’s certainly not for a lack of effort. It's just a really hard problem to solve.",Andrew Reed,Sequoia Capital

Agility is the name of the game. Speed kills.,Andrew Reed,Sequoia Capital
The next great software companies likely won’t look like much when they’re very young. Low or no-touch delivery models naturally require revenue to lag end-user adoption. But every customer that signs up is another piece of evidence of product/market fit and another rep for the company to improve product and improve customer experience.,Andrew Reed,Sequoia Capital
People of my generation view the cloud as their primary option. There’s neither a migration nor a change in mindset required. It’s just a better way.,Andrew Reed,Sequoia Capital
"I grew up with an identical twin brother, Will. We played football together in college. We probably had 10 competitions every day for 22 years. People tend to ask me why I’m so competitive - I can’t think of any better explanation than that.",Andrew Reed,Sequoia Capital
"The foremost part of an investment that we need to get right is the size of the market. When the opportunity is larger than commonly believed, great investments materialize. Small markets breed mediocre companies.",Andrew Reed,Sequoia Capital
"We try to provide lessons from the great companies we’ve worked with to empower young founders who, thankfully, don't have any preconceived notions.",Andrew Reed,Sequoia Capital
I think about a transmit/receive ratio — I try to keep mine as heavily weighted toward receive as possible.,Andrew Reed,Sequoia Capital
"Clarity of thought is a common factor in our great entrepreneurs. When they articulate their vision for the future, it seems almost inevitable.",Andrew Reed,Sequoia Capital
"There’s a great quote from Don Valentine when he was asked, “What makes for a great culture?” His answer? “Winning”. I wholeheartedly believe that.",Andrew Reed,Sequoia Capital
The times where I’ve learned and grown the most were only possible because someone chose to take a bet on me. I’m excited for the opportunity to pay that forward.,Amy Sun,Sequoia Capital
I start by listening. Founders know more about their business than I do. They’re the experts. I have to understand their space and their vision for the future before I can help them achieve it.,Amy Sun,Sequoia Capital
Autonomous vehicles will be transformative. I look forward to a world with fewer cars on the streets—and fewer streets. The concept of a permanent residence can become obsolete. I’d love to have an “apartment” that could take me from San Francisco to L.A.,Amy Sun,Sequoia Capital
"I’ve never had a car. When I lived in Seattle, relying on taxis was a nightmare. Uber changed my life. I loved it so much that I sent them my résumé.",Amy Sun,Sequoia Capital

"I’m passionate about self-expression through technology. I loved building and growing the Stories product at Facebook. I’m excited about how AR and VR will help us create art, express ourselves and understand each other. I love that you can now collaborate on a 3D sculpture with someone in China in real-time.

"My grandma grew up in rural China and left home at 16 to work at a factory in Beijing. She never graduated from high school, but she sent her sons to the best universities in China. She cooked for three families every day and still helped me with my math homework. She was like Wonder Woman.",Amy Sun,Sequoia Capital

"There’s a decal by my desk that says “You can have results or excuses, not both.” I’m an optimistic person, but I hold people accountable. Including myself.",Amy Sun,Sequoia Capital
