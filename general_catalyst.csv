"“I have the most fun working with entrepreneurs with strong product DNA and an ability to anticipate and facilitate contemporary consumer phenomena, while building the brands of the future. My background is strongly international, so I look for opportunities that go beyond borders.”",Adam Valkin,General Catalyst
"I focus on consumer and SMB-oriented businesses with an emphasis on mobile-first applications. Before I joined General Catalyst, my investments included LOVEFiLM (where I was co-founder and initial CEO), Spotify, Hailo, Fiverr, Kenshoo, peerTransfer, GoCardless, and Dragonplay. The companies I have been involved with at General Catalyst include Brainly, CCP, ClassPass, Deliveroo, Fundbox, Giphy, Super Evil Megacorp, Rebag, Vroom, Remesh, and WayUp.",Adam Valkin,General Catalyst
"If you’re pursuing ideas in next-generation online marketplaces, alternative finance, mobile applications for consumers and SMBs, and gaming, we can have a great conversation because those are the areas that interest me most.",Adam Valkin,General Catalyst
"I have worked with entrepreneurs for almost 20 years since my first job at a venture-backed startup in Boston in 1996. In this time I have gained valuable experience at startups, with incumbents and in venture. I have also had the opportunity to co-found two companies with successful exits, LOVEFiLM (acquired by Amazon) and Propertyfinder (acquired by REA).",Adam Valkin,General Catalyst
"I was born in South Africa and came to the U.S. to attend college. I graduated with a degree in economics from Harvard University and have been active as an investor and operator in the U.S., Europe and Israel. I lived in London for 14 years, and now split my time between Boston and New York with visits to California, the U.K. and Israel. One of the things I bring to entrepreneurs is a reality-based outlook on how to scale businesses internationally.",Adam Valkin,General Catalyst
"Outside of work, you’re likely to find me on the tennis court or in a fitness class, enjoying food, wine and travel, and spending time with the four women in my life: my wife and three daughters.",Adam Valkin,General Catalyst
“It amazes me that individuals can leverage technology to solve problems much more rapidly and effectively than can governments and organizations with far greater resources. I get excited when I meet founders determined to build big businesses that have a widespread impact across industries and on society.”,Addie Lerner,General Catalyst
"Studying the complexities of the Middle East at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton made it clear to me that private sector individuals and companies must play a role in solving the world’s biggest challenges – policy and politics alone are not sufficient. I wanted to understand how private businesses can create change more efficiently than governments, so I started my career at Goldman Sachs learning how to invest in growth-stage technology and services companies.",Addie Lerner,General Catalyst
"My enthusiasm for emerging consumer technologies around the world took me to General Atlantic, where I joined the Internet & Technology team in New York and worked on investments in Buzzfeed and Gilt Groupe. During a year in GA’s London office I had the privilege of working with incredible entrepreneurs and investors throughout Europe, Israel, and the Middle East who are leveraging technology to address important problems with a global focus.",Addie Lerner,General Catalyst
"At General Catalyst I am excited to get to know early-stage founders and growth-stage teams who are solving real problems – not just by replacing an existing approach but by pioneering a new path – and perhaps even creating new markets, such as the next-gen AI platform Remesh. Marketplace, commerce, data and content companies in the Health & Wellness and New Media spaces are particularly interesting to me. Those industries are being completely disrupted and democratized by innovative businesses that are doing everything from creating wider and cheaper access to healthcare to bringing content and information more quickly and cost-effectively to communities around the world.",Addie Lerner,General Catalyst
"When I’m not catching up with entrepreneurs, you can usually find me on a SoulCycle bike, reading up on Middle East policy news or attempting to learn how to cook. I also volunteer with StreetWise Partners to mentor motivated NYC job seekers, and while I love living in New York, I remain an avid fan of my hometown team, the Boston Red Sox.",Addie Lerner,General Catalyst
"“We take a team approach to investing. My role is managing the finance and operations organization to enable everyone else to focus on our mission: identifying stand-out entrepreneurs and helping them succeed. In that sense, we don’t have organizational overhead.”",Bill Fitzgerald,General Catalyst
"In addition to being a Managing Director, I’m also COO and help oversee finance, legal, compliance and administration. Everything I do has one purpose: making sure the General Catalyst investment team can focus on our entrepreneurs and investments.",Bill Fitzgerald,General Catalyst
"One of our strongest values as a firm is the commitment we have to collaborate with and challenge each other. That goes back years before we founded General Catalyst, when a number of us worked together at various companies, ranging from startups to national industry leaders. Today we listen to and mentor our entrepreneurs to take the same approach: build a team based on open, honest communication about roles, responsibilities, risks and rewards.",Bill Fitzgerald,General Catalyst
"This approach has enabled us to seek out different opinions and embrace ambiguity. Many of our best investments were highly debated decisions at the time, and we were able to have the right conversations and make the right call.",Bill Fitzgerald,General Catalyst
"Before co-founding General Catalyst, I was vice president and treasurer of a private equity group that acquired under-performing or strategically challenged businesses. Prior to that, I was with KPMG and an adjunct professor at Boston College. I graduated with a B.A. from the College Of The Holy Cross, and received a J.D. from Suffolk University Law School. Professional affiliations include the Association for Corporate Growth, the Financial Executives Institute and Director of the Private Equity CFO Association. I am an avid sports fan, played hockey in college before going to law school, and believe there is no substitute for sacrifice, preparation, teamwork and sportsmanship.",Bill Fitzgerald,General Catalyst

There’s so much energy in collaborating with smart, driven people and sharing their passion and conviction.”",Chris McCain,General Catalyst
"My official role is Chief Legal Officer, but at General Catalyst we all contribute to helping entrepreneurs overcome challenges, navigate obstacles, find creative solutions and seize opportunities.",Chris McCain,General Catalyst
"As an undergraduate at Boston College, I knew early on that I wanted to be an attorney so I spent a year studying law at Oxford University. While at Boston College law school, I became interested in working with early-stage companies because I was inspired by young entrepreneurs and their ability to see opportunity when most others do not. My first job was with Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian, LLP, which has a strong venture capital practice. Working in one of the firm’s smaller offices, I was able to roll up my sleeves and quickly learn about the world of venture capital transactions, start-up company needs and growing pains, M&A, fund formation and public offerings.",Chris McCain,General Catalyst
"After they opened their Boston office, I moved to Cooley LLP to benefit from their larger platform for supporting entrepreneurs, venture capital firms and complex M&A. Both Gunderson’s and Cooley’s roots are on the west coast, so I was able to have a window into the Silicon Valley approach to entrepreneurs and start-ups while also working here on the east coast.",Chris McCain,General Catalyst
"Today, I seek to leverage these prior experiences to support our team of dynamic, creative and intelligent individuals here at General Catalyst as well as our diverse ecosystem of exceptional and talented entrepreneurs.",Chris McCain,General Catalyst
"My wife and I have three young sons, who are the only people I know that have more energy than our entrepreneurs. When there’s time to relax (and there isn’t much with the boys), I enjoy throwing my support behind Boston’s sports teams (and, of course, the Boston College Eagles).",Chris McCain,General Catalyst
"“In my opinion, an entrepreneur is someone who puts everything else aside to build the world they want to live in.”",Dan Giovacchini,General Catalyst
"I first became hooked on the startup world when I won prize money in business plan competitions during my undergraduate years at Brown University. I now feel blessed to work with visionary founders on a daily basis. We live in a remarkable time where incredible revolutions in the technology stack have given us the potential to drastically improve the human condition. At General Catalyst, I am looking to forge relationships with exceptional entrepreneurs who have creatively reimagined a status quo or have even conceived of a new space entirely.",Dan Giovacchini,General Catalyst
"I started my time in investing at Accel Partners in Palo Alto before joining General Catalyst’s team in Cambridge.  Personally, I try to help founders think about turning products into platforms: What problems are solved for the customer? What additional services do customers use? How can their experience be improved?  I believe that General Catalyst provides founders and entrepreneurs with the resources and tools to help navigate these questions as well as other challenges and demands they face as they develop and scale their businesses.",Dan Giovacchini,General Catalyst
"Ever since I can remember, I’ve been a big believer in goal setting and fearless dreaming. I was born with moderate-severe hearing loss, but by setting my sights high and embracing my challenges I eventually became captain of the Brown University football team and graduated with a degree in Business Economics. I’ve been fortunate to share publicly my experiences with hearing impairment, sports, and overcoming obstacles in an effort to inspire others with physical disabilities.",Dan Giovacchini,General Catalyst
"While my days of blasting Phil Collins and Eminem in the locker room and tackling running backs are over, my big appetite and love for team competition remains! When I’m not at General Catalyst, you can find me playing early morning pickup basketball, practicing on my guitar, or waterskiing at my family’s New Hampshire summer home on Lake Winnisquam.",Dan Giovacchini,General Catalyst
“I love working with creative people and helping them make a difference. I am inspired by founders with big transformational ideas; that’s why our entrepreneurs include young people still in college all the way up to serial founders on their fifth or sixth company.”,David Fialkow,General Catalyst

"Before Joel Cutler and I co-founded General Catalyst, together we built and sold four companies including National Leisure Group; Alliance Development Group (sold to MyPoints.com); Retail Growth ATM Systems (sold to PNC Bank); and Starboard Cruise Services (sold to LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Inc.).",David Fialkow,General Catalyst

"Before going into business, I studied filmmaking at Colgate University, then earned a law degree from Boston College.  Over the last twenty-five years, I have raised tens of millions of dollars for children’s charities by biking, running, climbing and rowing. My wife, Nina, and I still make documentaries focused on healthcare and social justice; our film Icarus,  sold at Sundance in 2017 in one of the largest deals for non-fiction films in Sundance’s history, and won the Academy Award in 2018 for Best Documentary Film.   My non-profit boards include Facing History and Ourselves as well as serving as chairman of the board of The Pan-Mass Challenge and chair of the Investment Advisory Committee of The Engine.",David Fialkow,General Catalyst

"“I get excited about operational excellence, because that’s what makes ideas come to life as products, companies, and platforms for other people to build on. When ambitious founders find operating wisdom and experience that complements their vision, amazing things happen.”",David Orfao,General Catalyst
"I have spent my entire career working with great founders. Early on, my focus was scaling revenue for early-stage software companies. As those companies grew and went public, I rose with them to lead sales or the entire company. It was a great run, including technology leaders such as Lotus Development, Ashton-Tate, Frame Technology, Claris, and SQA.",David Orfao,General Catalyst
"The culmination was leading Allaire Corporation, which created Cold Fusion, the app server that launched the client-server web apps era. The company was small when I became CEO, but together with the Allaire brothers and team, we took it past $100 million in revenue in just a few years, and ultimately to a public offering and eventual merger into Macromedia/Adobe.",David Orfao,General Catalyst
"Now I get to work with entrepreneurs as a co-founder of General Catalyst, but my playbook is similar. I work best with great product founders who are looking for a trustworthy partner to help them scale up revenue, become strong operators, and build a high-growth company in the software, SaaS, application, information analytics, or security space. I still love to see teams come together, forge bonds of trust and commitment, and then go out and change the world with high integrity. I am directly involved with Circle Financial, Clearsky, Imprivata, and Rstudio. I’m also on the board of Brightcove, which was formerly a General Catalyst portfolio company.",David Orfao,General Catalyst
"My business background began at Norwich University, where I studied business and accounting. Although I’m fortunate to be one of those people who enjoys his work so much that it doesn’t feel like work, I always make time for my family. One of our favorite pastimes is boating on the Cape and islands during summer weekends in New England.",David Orfao,General Catalyst
"“When I catch myself wishing I was the developer or scientist who just pitched an idea, that’s the moment I realize ‘we need to back this.’ Real conviction is contagious.”",Denali Tietjen,General Catalyst
"As a digital native, I grew up with technology-enabled communications and began exploring them seriously in college with a senior thesis about journalism in the age of Twitter. I got my intro to the start-up world as a reporter focused on investing at Forbes and The Boston Globe. Inspired by the many entrepreneurs I covered, particularly the Cymbal team (a startup backed by Rough Draft Ventures), I realized I didn’t want to just write about the future of digital society, I wanted to help create it.",Denali Tietjen,General Catalyst
"So I joined Rough Draft as a student investor while still at Tufts University. I participated in the Monday evening pitch meetings, voted on investment decisions, recruited talent at universities and tech competitions, and poured my journalism skills into helping teams find their product voice.",Denali Tietjen,General Catalyst
"As an investor, I’m excited to continue working with student teams through Rough Draft. Student founders have a special energy that drives them to get started now, not someday. I also want to encourage more women to go on the startup journey. That includes working with universities to create the conditions for women to see themselves as entrepreneurs.",Denali Tietjen,General Catalyst
"I love General Catalyst’s focus on bringing great people together to form teams, and keeping those people close to the firm throughout their careers. By investing in a team, not just a product, we’re in it for the long haul.",Denali Tietjen,General Catalyst
"I graduated from Tufts (’16) with a degree in economics and film & media studies. I’m a marathon runner (most recently Reykjavik) and am up for pretty much anything outdoors. I would also love to keep traveling, having spent summers exploring in Europe, Latin America and Asia.",Denali Tietjen,General Catalyst
"“The start-up journey includes rapid growth and constant need for good internal communication, particularly when your company is growing fast. That’s been true for General Catalyst, as well.”",Frank Maher,General Catalyst
"As the controller for General Catalyst, I basically have my eyes on every dollar that comes in or goes out. I’m also responsible for financial and tax reporting, budgeting, and work related to our investment funds. What makes my job fun is doing all these things in a dynamic business that’s operating on two coasts and supports great founders and their companies.",Frank Maher,General Catalyst
"I’ve been with General Catalyst from the beginning. While we’ve grown over the years, we’ve remained one team with one set of values. That doesn’t mean we’re old-fashioned. We know how to leverage great new tools as part of our operations, and we value communication and an open-door policy.",Frank Maher,General Catalyst
"Before joining the firm, I served in a variety of finance roles in a range of industries, including apparel, yard machinery, medical instruments and management consulting.",Frank Maher,General Catalyst
"I’m proud to say I’m a dyed-in-the-wool Bostonian: born, raised and educated here from grammar school through graduate school (MBA at Suffolk University). I even married a Bostonian. I picked up golf as a caddy at age 12 and still love it decades later.",Frank Maher,General Catalyst

I focus on working with founders who are building technology companies with an authentic mission. A mission-driven company usually requires an investor with patience and long-term perspective; and I feel those are my core strengths.,Hemant Taneja,General Catalyst
"My investment thesis is based on an overall view that 21st century businesses will thrive on Economies of Unscale, and there is an incredible opportunity to redesign most application workflows with first principles. My investments at General Catalyst include Angle Technologies, ClassDojo, Fractyl, Grammarly, Gridco Systems, Gusto, Highfive, Livongo, Samsara, Snap (NYSE: SNAP), Stripe, ThoughtSpot, Color Genomics and TuneIn. I also direct the GC Stripe Platform Fund, a $10 million initiative to help start new ventures that are built on top of the Stripe Connect platform.",Hemant Taneja,General Catalyst
"I wound up with five degrees from MIT because I was hoping to pursue an academic career: Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (BS and MS), Operations Research (MS), Mathematics (BS), Biology & Biomedical Engineering (BS). In hindsight, that was excellent training for being a venture capitalist because I am always curious about new areas of innovation.",Hemant Taneja,General Catalyst
"Alongside my work here at General Catalyst, I founded Advanced Energy Economy (AEE), an organization focused on transforming energy policy in America. I am also a board member of Khan Academy, whose mission is to provide free world-class education for everyone. I have regularly taught students at MIT and at Stanford University with a focus on helping them find impactful problems to work on.",Hemant Taneja,General Catalyst
"“The best businesses offer customers something truly valuable, whether it’s mission-critical infrastructure, an amazing experience, or an application that simplifies processes. My philosophy as an investor is to bring entrepreneurs exceptional value through a trusted partnership — helping to scale their companies to the next level while further innovating, building unique cultures, and delivering an excellent customer experience.”",Holly Maloney McConnell,General Catalyst
"I discovered my passion for collaborating with successful management teams early in my profession while advising technology companies at AGC.  I learned from the start that the best relationships between companies and investors are based on philosophical alignment around the opportunity at hand and how to maximize it. Working alongside founders and executives as a board member has been critical to developing an innate sense for finding that alignment, building on it, and achieving a shared vision for the business.",Holly Maloney McConnell,General Catalyst
"I began my career as an investor at Guidepost Growth Equity (FKA: North Bridge Growth Equity) several years ago. I worked hard to build a foundation for what I hoped to be a long-term career: sourcing and executing investments in software-based companies; and cultivating trusted relationships with entrepreneurs and industry executives. While there, I worked closely with companies such as Dyn, Erecruit, Spoonflower, and WP Engine and was focused on infrastructure, communications, human capital management, marketplaces, manufacturing, and digital media. I remain interested in these categories of companies, which operate with highly scalable revenue models that may include subscriptions, transactions, and high margin services.",Holly Maloney McConnell,General Catalyst
"At General Catalyst, I focus on later-stage companies that have already achieved some success and have demonstrated capital efficiency prior to our involvement, like the sports management platform, Teamworks.",Holly Maloney McConnell,General Catalyst
Scaling a successful business into one that defines or disrupts a category often involves pattern recognition – knowing in advance how events are likely to unfold – and the team at General Catalyst has those insights in abundance. I am fortunate to be surrounded by the wealth of experience within this team.,Holly Maloney McConnell,General Catalyst
"While I find true passion in my work, I also enjoy being as active (and admittedly, competitive) as I can – running, hiking, biking, exploring. Surfing is a new discovery, so I’m eager to hear about your favorite breaks. Given the significant role the sport played in my life, I proudly support the Boston chapter of Soccer Without Borders, an international organization that serves young people in under-resourced communities through the game.",Holly Maloney McConnell,General Catalyst
“I really want to meet ridiculously creative founders. Great things seem to happen when you get the right combination of amazing people and ideas in the room.”,Joel Cutler,General Catalyst
"As a founder, mentor and venture capital investor, I support young entrepreneurs for their entire start-up journey. I love big ideas and being able to establish leaders in a new field that isn’t already saturated with a flock of me-too companies. If you’re going into a market or a region where others got there first, you can’t be just a little better. To be a leader, you have to be at least ten times better. Better yet is charting new territory. Then you get to define a space, make something out of nothing and define leadership.",Joel Cutler,General Catalyst
"To me, a great team with a good idea beats a good team with a great idea. That helps set General Catalyst apart from other firms: we work as a team internally, and with the founders of our companies, to create the greatest possible impact for the ideas that have come our way.",Joel Cutler,General Catalyst
"I spent my entrepreneurial career building travel, specialty/targeted consumer direct commerce and consumer fintech businesses before starting General Catalyst with my friend David Fialkow. That experience has served me well in helping entrepreneurs building really new and next-generation consumer products and services.",Joel Cutler,General Catalyst
"In the early days of General Catalyst, I was fortunate to partner with Paul English and Steve Hafner to start KAYAK in our offices to provide consumers with an easy and transparent way to purchase travel services online.",Joel Cutler,General Catalyst
"I like working with great teams that relentlessly focus on creating real inflection points in consumer experiences. One of my favorite things is to think through the confluence of new technology platforms and disruptive business models that can be the foundation of new consumer experiences. Companies I’m currently involved with are Airbnb, Cadre, Freebird, Handy, Lemonade, Lola,  M.Gemi, Oscar Insurance, Rockets of Awesome and Warby Parker. Some of my previous investments include GroupMe (acquired by Skype), ITA Software (acquired by Google), Jet (acquired by Walmart), OLX (acquired by Naspers), Reveal Imaging (acquired by SAIC), and Venmo (acquired first by Braintree and then by eBay).",Joel Cutler,General Catalyst
"I graduated from Colby College and Boston College Law School. Along with the boards of companies I am involved with, I also serve on the boards of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Boston Children’s Hospital Trust.",Joel Cutler,General Catalyst
“I am amazed how advances in technology have enabled entrepreneurs to start companies virtually anywhere – I love getting to know entrepreneurs and companies that are off the beaten path.”,John Monagle,General Catalyst
"I focus on investments in application and infrastructure SaaS companies, with a particular interest in innovative trends around information technology. As part of that work, I help lead the Velocity Network, which connects enterprise decision makers with emerging start-ups.",John Monagle,General Catalyst
"Before joining General Catalyst, I worked at Insight Venture Partners in New York, where I sourced, evaluated, and helped manage growth-stage software investments. I also worked for The Walt Disney Company where I supported Disney’s growth and emerging businesses. I attended Princeton University, where I graduated with honors from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. While at Princeton, I learned to speak Mandarin.",John Monagle,General Catalyst
"Outside of the office, I volunteer with Minds Matter Boston, a non-profit organization focused on mentoring and preparing high school students from low-income families for college success. I also enjoy traveling to new cities and rooting for New York sports teams (which I do quietly considering that I live in Boston).",John Monagle,General Catalyst
"“Having spent the majority of my life working with technology, I love helping companies build systems that enable people to work more efficiently so they can focus on running their businesses.”",Jon Rehagen,General Catalyst
"One of my first entrepreneurial experiences came just a year after I graduated from Newbury College near Boston. I had studied management information systems, and my team recommended I try IT consulting. I took this advice, and it was sink or swim. I swam. Now when I meet entrepreneurs connected with General Catalyst who are having their own sink-or-swim moment, it’s a thrill to be one of the people in a position to help them succeed.",Jon Rehagen,General Catalyst
"I support everyone at the firm as well as the startups we invest in, so my skills and experience all come into play. I get to be both systematic, relying on strong methodologies, and flexible, tailoring the solution to the situation. My passion is sharing my knowledge and helping others, whether it’s by working together to tackle a challenge or coming up with a solution that helps people run their businesses better.",Jon Rehagen,General Catalyst
"Venture capital is a competitive business, and IT is table stakes, so everything has to work, all the time, for people who might be getting on a plane to anywhere in the world. Availability and security are my highest priorities. When new companies get formed in our offices, I’m usually the person who sets them up. I’ve been at General Catalyst long enough to remember configuring the first two computers and domains for the founders of KAYAK, and supporting Rob Gierkink to get ready to launch Datalogix.",Jon Rehagen,General Catalyst
"I was raised in a small town in Maine, and I bring those values to my high-tech work: listening, caring, looking for common ground while also appreciating individual differences. On the weekends, I love road trips, cooking, reading, and kicking a soccer ball around the park with my fiancée. I also enjoy getting out on the golf course – a great way to combine a little business with pleasure.",Jon Rehagen,General Catalyst
"“Great companies and great stories have the same key elements: universal appeal, imperfect protagonists and an important mission that simply must be achieved. I look for founders who don’t just tell a good story, but truly embrace this quest to build something transformative.”",Katherine Boyle,General Catalyst
"As a reporter for the Washington Post when Jeff Bezos bought the paper, I investigated entrepreneurship in many forms. Every industry I covered, including my own, was being turned on its head by founders with fresh ideas. I finally decided to leave reporting so I, too, could be part of this world and help uncommon people accomplish epic missions.",Katherine Boyle,General Catalyst
"While getting an MBA at Stanford, I worked in venture capital and saw that the founders I was drawn to don’t have perfectly polished narratives. Like heroes in great literature, they’re quirky, daring and driven to have an impact that lasts. So when I meet with founders, I still think like a reporter: I search for the big story, one where its telling will make the future different for all of us.",Katherine Boyle,General Catalyst
"Like my colleagues at General Catalyst, I’m eager to champion startups that shake up highly regulated industries, from healthcare to transportation to labor. I actually welcome that extra layer of challenge because it means we’re addressing complex problems. I’m also drawn to really “unsexy” spaces and startups that tackle tired industries in need of an upgrade. Last but not least, I come from a small college town, so my door will always be open to innovations that touch everyone, not just people living in big cities.",Katherine Boyle,General Catalyst
"Before Stanford, I received a BA at Georgetown and an MA from the National University of Ireland in Galway. I’m a lifelong fan of the arts, particularly classical music. I’m also an avid reader with a yen for history and foreign affairs. If there’s an obscure book that you couldn’t put down, I’d love to hear about it.",Katherine Boyle,General Catalyst
"“GC is comprised of mission-driven people who approach their work with passion, energy, and commitment.

"In the technology industry, every day holds the promise of working with intelligent people that challenge themselves and those around them to think even bigger than we thought possible. Ambition can never be underestimated. At General Catalyst, I look forward to partnering with founders and senior leaders who are both intellectually curious and highly motivated to tackle large, greenfield opportunities in internet, software and beyond.",Kyle Doherty,General Catalyst
"I began my career as an equity analyst immersed in the growth possibilities for tech companies that were already valued at tens of billions of dollars. While challenging, it wasn’t quite capturing the entrepreneurial energy that was driving much of the innovation happening in the economy. A business degree later, I had my first opportunity in venture on storied Sand Hill Road working at Morgenthaler where I focused on consumer internet investments. From there, I flexed my entrepreneurial muscle and joined Coatue Management where I helped conceive and launch their private investment practice. Over the course of five years, I helped oversee rapid growth on the West Coast from a team of two into a leading private technology investment platform.",Kyle Doherty,General Catalyst
"Previous experience working with companies ranging from the smallest to the largest has given me a wholly unique perspective of the technology landscape. Whether it’s two developers and a dog in a Palo Alto garage or a scaled social networking platform with billions in revenue, I can help founders and executives move their businesses forward.",Kyle Doherty,General Catalyst
"Originally from the Boston area, I studied economics and finance at MIT and went on to earn an MBA from Harvard Business School. I’ve stayed true to my hometown roots and remain a big fan of the Celtics and the Patriots. On quiet, non-game weekends, I can be found hiking the great Bay Area vistas with my wife and border collie, Brady.",Kyle Doherty,General Catalyst

I also co-founded the Velocity Network, which connects enterprise decision makers with emerging start-ups.",Larry Bohn,General Catalyst
"My path to becoming a venture capitalist is quite unusual. I delivered groceries, drove a taxi, worked on a farm, was a short-order cook, and managed a pool hall before getting a BA in English from UMass Amherst and an MA in English Linguistics from Clark University. Later, I taught composition and literature at a junior college. With an undergrad class in Fortran and some writing skills, I got a job at Data General and rode the wave that has made software the most important technology of our time.",Larry Bohn,General Catalyst
"My investment focus today includes new and existing businesses in open-source, cloud-based computing, and SaaS business models, especially with a focus on commerce and analytic applications.",Larry Bohn,General Catalyst
"Outside of work, I’m an avid cyclist and woodworker. I’ve been a rider in the Pan-Mass Challenge (PMC) for 17 years and have contributed to raising over $400 million for the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. I’m also a proud dad (two grown kids working in healthcare) and not a perfect husband married to a near perfect wife.",Larry Bohn,General Catalyst
"“We are all about helping our portfolio company founders build teams that work together seamlessly. Inside General Catalyst, we practice what we preach. The integration between disciplines is extraordinarily high, and that benefits the entrepreneurs we support.”",Mark Allen,General Catalyst
"My first experience of General Catalyst came when I worked at PwC. At that time, General Catalyst was just a year old. More than a decade later, I was reunited with our COO, Bill Fitzgerald, and the rest of the General Catalyst team when I joined them to manage the financial accounting, reporting and treasury functions. We’ve all grown a bit, but the spirit, energy and values that helped form General Catalyst are as vital as ever.",Mark Allen,General Catalyst
"One of the best things about working with General Catalyst is the rich interaction across the various teams and among the highly varied individuals. On a daily basis, those of us in finance and operations work directly with the investment team to help support them and their entrepreneurs in many aspects of the business.",Mark Allen,General Catalyst
"One of my roles is to utilize technology to increase efficiency – something many of our entrepreneurs are doing with their visionary businesses. We’re always looking for ways to streamline operations so our investment team has more time for our entrepreneurs and their companies. That makes this part of my job truly mission-driven, which only adds to how much I enjoy it.",Mark Allen,General Catalyst
"I am a true New Englander, raised and educated in Vermont, and later attended Northeastern University for my MBA. I’m still able to beat my three young daughters down the ski slopes, and I enjoy a round of golf on the weekend.",Mark Allen,General Catalyst
"“I have deep admiration for entrepreneurs who push the limits to make what they believe in happen. They deserve the best possible circumstances for taking their ideas as far as they can go, and my role is to help create those circumstances in ways that extend far beyond funding.”",Matthew Brennan,General Catalyst
"I became interested in entrepreneurship early on in life. Most of the jobs I held before graduating from the University of Pennsylvania were primarily running businesses I started myself. I enjoyed the combination of freedom and responsibility, and I also gained huge respect for people who have realized the only limitations for success are the ones they put on themselves. That’s why I went to The Wharton School at Penn: to be around entrepreneurial people and learn about building companies.",Matthew Brennan,General Catalyst
"I started my investment career at Insight Venture Partners and then joined Bain Capital Ventures.  I have focused mainly on investments in application software, SaaS, financial technology and data-services companies, including working with companies, such as Chrome River, AvidXchange, IEX, Swift, and Passport, among others. Doing this work instilled a deep appreciation of how hard it is to build a company and a passionate desire to help entrepreneurs by bringing them expertise and experience that complements theirs.",Matthew Brennan,General Catalyst
"Coming to General Catalyst felt like a natural fit because of the great diversity of backgrounds and skills of the people at the firm. This plays into my strengths in both analyzing and articulating where the emerging opportunities lie for growth-stage companies. When investors support and guide entrepreneurs with awareness of patterns and nuances of each company, everyone wins.",Matthew Brennan,General Catalyst
"I’m fascinated by companies that have a rich stream of data and information, whether they are originating it, managing it or transacting with it. Companies that develop and win such a market position eventually become the ones the rest of us can’t do without. If you have a perspective around this, I’m eager to hear it.",Matthew Brennan,General Catalyst
"On the personal side, my sense of adventure comes out in travel; when we vacation, my wife and I love to explore other cultures around the world. Closer to home, I enjoy skiing, tennis, running, and cooking.",Matthew Brennan,General Catalyst
“Change is hard to implement. Big ideas about the future run into entrenched interests. I believe in investments that help entrepreneurs with powerful ideas overcome adversity to create a better world.”,Megan Maloney,General Catalyst
"Jumping from a small town to the high-intensity environment of Columbia University in New York, I had to treat my education like a mission: focus my abilities, rise above the competition, and open doors to a bigger future. This was similar to an entrepreneur’s mindset in some ways, because I was raised to challenge the status quo. While studying economics, I was asking how we could make capital work more effectively to create the outcomes we all want as a society. I didn’t want to just study issues. I wanted to fix them.",Megan Maloney,General Catalyst
"During my time at Morgan Stanley, I developed a deep passion for technology. I loved working with research analysts to present their strategies to investors because it required fast, accurate synthesis of large amounts of information for a tangible result. Then I moved to the technology investment banking group, where I worked on raising and allocating capital for tech-based companies at critical moments in their evolution. As a result, I can simultaneously understand the motivations of the CEO of a company and its institutional investors – who both want to scale that company 10X.",Megan Maloney,General Catalyst
"At General Catalyst, I am excited to work with founders whose companies align with my core values, the most important of which is helping others. As the majority of the world gains access to the Internet, I believe we are at an inflection point in how consumers behave, and how businesses can channel that behavior for economic and social impact. If you have an idea about how to magnify or direct these forces, I would love to explore it with you. If others just aren’t getting it, there’s a chance I will.",Megan Maloney,General Catalyst
"Outside of work, I hit the streets in my running shoes and volunteer for organizations that improve the lives of others. My lifelong hobby as a musician also continues, on multiple instruments.

"My role at General Catalyst is leading the day-to-day operations of our Executive-in-Residence (XIR) program, including our sourcing strategy, recruiting, marketing and serving as a liaison between XIRs and the General Catalyst ecosystem. I help lead the Velocity Network, which connects enterprise decision makers with emerging start-ups.",Molly Gillis,General Catalyst
"I’ve been fortunate to have the opportunity to create and define this position, which has been a theme of my work for General Catalyst. I originally joined the firm to run investor relations, marketing, PR and internal communications just after we raised our first institutional fund, when the founders and early employees were establishing how the firm would operate and what it would become.",Molly Gillis,General Catalyst
"After six years as General Catalyst’s vice president of communications, I joined BBN Technologies, a General Catalyst portfolio company. As executive officer at BBN, I focused on business strategy and operations and worked with the Board of Directors and management team to consummate the sale of the company to Raytheon, where I co-led integration post-acquisition. After that, I was executive director of development at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center where, as part of the development leadership team, I ran operations, board relations, events, annual giving and internal communications. Just before rejoining General Catalyst, I rebranded Leerink Partners, a healthcare investment bank, where I led marketing, PR and internal communications. I was delighted when General Catalyst asked me to come back to run the XIR program. In this role, I have the privilege of working with entrepreneurs and world-class operators every day to ensure that they have access to the resources and tools they need to build their vision into transformational businesses.",Molly Gillis,General Catalyst
"I’m originally from Los Angeles, and came east to study creative writing at Emerson College where I earned my M.A. in publishing. I’m an avid reader and still write in my spare time – when I’m not daydreaming about surviving the Zombie Apocalypse (I’m a huge fan of the Walking Dead), goofing off with my two young sons, cooking big dinners (I love food) or hiking with our dog in the woods behind our home just outside of Boston.",Molly Gillis,General Catalyst
"“Founders are committed to a journey that advances their own intellectual curiosities.  It is both admirable and inspiring, as it is the best learning one could ever imagine.”",Natalie Bartlett,General Catalyst
"I have had the good fortune of working with founders in multiple capacities: as part of a four-person start-up team at Socrative (acquired by MasteryConnect), as a student Venture Fellow with Rough Draft Ventures, and as a platform manager at venture capital companies on both coasts where I focused on building strategic partnerships and scaling portfolio resources.",Natalie Bartlett,General Catalyst
"Helping young companies grow is a natural extension of my graduate work in technology and innovation at Harvard. When I began working with the Rough Draft Ventures team, I identified the needs common to our student founders and developed the infrastructure to support our student teams, as well as the university entrepreneurship ecosystem.",Natalie Bartlett,General Catalyst
"At General Catalyst, I look forward to supporting Rough Draft Ventures’ founders who are developing new tools that create increased productivity and cohesiveness among industries. This is an area where technology and learning can intersect at deeper levels, to break down industry silos and increase collaboration for both individuals and organizations.",Natalie Bartlett,General Catalyst
"My background includes directing the inaugural Mobile First Summits in 2014 and 2015 and leadership roles at Women in Wireless, a non-profit that aims to develop female leaders in technology. These inspiring examples left an early, strong impression on me regarding the impact women are capable of making in the tech world, and I am bringing this advocacy with me to General Catalyst.",Natalie Bartlett,General Catalyst
"Before getting my Masters degree in Technology and Innovation at Harvard, I earned my degree in Communication, Behavior, and Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.

"“I don’t mind if you weren’t born in the U.S. or if your accent sounds funny – mine does for sure. I also don’t care whether you went to Stanford or you’re a domain expert yet. I believe that talent is universal, even if opportunity is not.”",Niko Bonatsos,General Catalyst
"My passion is working with first-time technology founders with strong product instincts, who treat every decision as a learning moment. These are essential traits of entrepreneurs who build great companies.",Niko Bonatsos,General Catalyst
"I particularly enjoy investing early in consumer products and services that most people might perceive as crazy, funny, and controversial; those strong reactions tell me there is something disruptive going on.",Niko Bonatsos,General Catalyst
"Similarly, I look for consumer products and services that streamline existing cumbersome workflows.
I believe technology exists to make our lives better. Combine this with a hot market, and billion-dollar companies can be created. General Catalyst companies I’m involved with include All Turtles, Atrium LTS, Brighter (acquired by Cigna in December 2017), Castle Global, ClassDojo, Cover, Livongo Health, NatureBox,  PumpUp, RealtyShares, Snap (NYSE: SNAP), and Wag!.",Niko Bonatsos,General Catalyst
"My intellectual curiosity and ambition to maximize serendipity (my life’s function) led me to be a perpetual student in multiple countries. I ended up graduating from Stanford (MS in Management Science and Engineering as a Fulbright Scholar), the University of Cambridge (M.Phil. in Manufacturing Engineering and Management) and the National Technical University of Athens (Dipl.-Ing in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science). I also worked in Tokyo at the R&D headquarters for Yokogawa Electric Corporation. This random walk through the world has proven to be extremely helpful in my role as an early-stage investor.",Niko Bonatsos,General Catalyst
"“My experience is that if you surround yourself with talented people you respect, admire and care about, other things fall into place – your team can perform to its full potential. That’s what brought me to General Catalyst, where everyone is truly part of the team.”",Olivia Lew,General Catalyst
"My curiosity and love of problem solving developed early in life, in part because my parents are both doctors, and in part because I grew up in a bilingual household. I learned to think beyond geographical and cultural borders and took advantage of several opportunities to study abroad. Those experiences helped me realize how much the world needs fresh ideas that can take root and make a difference for people.",Olivia Lew,General Catalyst
"When I finished college at Middlebury I went into the non-profit sector, where I quickly became engaged in recruiting and activating passionate entrepreneurs to support environmental causes. I felt that the corporate world could offer an opportunity to make a larger impact, leading me to earn an MBA at Georgetown. From there, I went into public and private sector consulting with Booz Allen Hamilton and then Capgemini, which included opportunities to work in Europe and Asia.",Olivia Lew,General Catalyst
"Implementing enterprise transformations while consulting Global 500 companies allowed me to develop skills around collaboration, creative thinking, and change management which I will apply to my role at General Catalyst. I enjoy working closely with early-stage founders who believe in their mission so passionately that they aren’t deterred by barriers – they just break right through them.",Olivia Lew,General Catalyst

"Technology has made the world more of a meritocracy than it’s ever been and traditional obstacles to success are quickly collapsing. Everywhere you look, there’s an opportunity to take something important and make it better. I want to work with people who think it’s their job to do that. I started my first company when I was 17, and my life’s work is to help amazing people change the world through entrepreneurship and invention.",Phil Libin,General Catalyst
"I’m the co-founder and former CEO & executive chairman of Evernote. I was a managing director at General Catalyst before founding All Turtles, an AI start-up studio.",Phil Libin,General Catalyst
"Given the potential product advancements and breakthroughs leveraging AI and conversational UI technologies, there is shift underway in how these technologies can reshape the way people interact with computers.  Throughout the majority of my career as a founder and executive building companies from an initial idea into larger enterprises, I have developed a deep passion and understanding of the time and effort it takes to develop a great product while, at the same time, building a company around those products.  In order to build upon these experiences, I decided to start All Turtles so we could provide entrepreneurs and product visionaries with company building support in order to help them navigate the obstacles and challenges that can come from operating and growing a young company so that their primary focus and passion can remain on the development of a new generation of products.",Phil Libin,General Catalyst
"“It’s not always easy being ahead of the curve, solving for problems that haven’t even occurred to most people. But that’s exactly where you need to be to make culture-shifting ideas a reality. Supporting the founders and their stories of pushing the ‘what’s next’ is why we’re here.”",Ronda Scott,General Catalyst
"One of the challenges for any entrepreneur is figuring out how to tell the story behind the idea. Whether that idea is bringing a new consumer product to market, disrupting the tech stack from at the lowest levels or introducing a better way to tackle a medical problem, the right story introduces the idea and instantly changes the conversations around it. My role at General Catalyst is to help GC and our founders craft and communicate stories that do just that.",Ronda Scott,General Catalyst
"I started my tech-focused career during the “dot boom” managing the incredibly vibrant communities on Excite.com. The web was still a brand new experience for most. The possibilities it introduced for connecting people to knowledge, information, and to each other felt endless and Excite had some of the most engaged communities online.",Ronda Scott,General Catalyst
"In the early 2000s, I joined LucasArts to lead public relations for Star Wars Galaxies, the first-ever MMO—or massively multiplayer online game—set in the Star Wars universe. With Galaxies, we told stories about concepts that were just emerging at the time: immersive gaming culture, virtual economies, and love and death in these persistent worlds where millions of people were interacting every day.",Ronda Scott,General Catalyst
"Spending the better part of the ‘00s working with Rhapsody, the foundational music streaming service, and companies like Sonos, I had front row seats to the fundamental ways streaming changed the ways we discovered, valued and enjoyed music. From there, I moved to Evernote to lead content and communications for a team that was doing something similarly impactful, but this time for personal productivity.",Ronda Scott,General Catalyst
"At General Catalyst, we invest in such a wide breadth of areas that every day is another opportunity to learn.

"When I’m home on weekends, I can be found tending to my chickens, veggie garden, and/or my 1972 GMC project truck. I’m originally from Central New York, but the west coast vibe (and, let’s be honest, the weather) has won me over and here’s where I think I’ll stay.",Ronda Scott,General Catalyst
"“The hardest part of being an entrepreneur is not predicting the future, but timing it. My mission is to identify and support founders who have an astounding sense for where we are in history, coupled with the courage and talent to will a vision into existence.”",Spencer Lazar,General Catalyst
"I’m particularly excited by entrepreneurs who use technology to democratize access to products and services that previously were available only to a few. My investment focus has been on new service delivery models for both consumers and businesses, such as those at Bowery, ClassPass, FundBox, Giphy, Lemonade and WayUp.",Spencer Lazar,General Catalyst
"The companies that interest me most offer services that leverage network effects driven by a community, a marketplace, or data. When a product can get better with each incremental user, customers win, competition suffers, and outcomes can be massive.",Spencer Lazar,General Catalyst
"I joined General Catalyst to help open our New York Office and have spent most of my working life in the venture ecosystem – mostly as an investor but also as a venture-backed entrepreneur. I cut my teeth at Insight Venture Partners, where I sourced and managed growth stage investments in 3P Learning (ASX: 3PL), BeyondTrust (acquired by Veritas Capital), and GenArts. Working with Accel Partners in London gave me broad international perspective, and I sourced and worked with companies such as Birchbox, Bonobos, ForgeRock, Hailo, Lyst, Top10, and Qriously. Then it was time to take a bet on myself. Back in New York, I built Spontaneously, an early iOS-based mobile calendar.",Spencer Lazar,General Catalyst
"I graduated from Harvard University with a degree in economics. School for me was all about trying to understand how people make decisions: what success looks like and where we go wrong. The timeliness of an opportunity in many ways stems from the strength of an entrepreneur’s understanding of this fundamental human psychology. One of the great joys of this business is getting to partner with students of the past, present, and future.",Spencer Lazar,General Catalyst

"Prior to General Catalyst, I was CTO and senior vice president of R&D at VMware. I worked on the underlying technology in graduate school and joined the company in 2001… what a journey. I had an incredible experience as we built a world-class engineering team with 3,000 people, delivered numerous industry-changing products, and achieved over $4 billion in annual revenue. I also played a role in more than 20 acquisitions. I want to help new companies achieve similar success, with an eye particularly toward building world-class engineering teams and strategic product plans.",Dr. Steve Herrod,General Catalyst

"“An entrepreneur’s passion is contagious – it brings out the best in those around them. It’s the people, not just the technologies, that are changing the world for the better.”",Tom Holahan,General Catalyst
"I came to venture investing via an unusual route. My first job out of college was for NBC Sports, which might seem like a natural choice for a four-year college football player. In reality, I was drawn to the job just as much because of my interest in complex systems and how they work. Helping cover the 2014 Olympic Winter Games was an incredible opportunity to do that; I never expected that it would also come with an Emmy award for our team.",Tom Holahan,General Catalyst
"My next career step was into private equity at Symmetric Capital, sourcing investment opportunities in later-stage companies where it became obvious that our macroeconomic system can be disrupted almost anywhere due to the powerful technology tools now available. The best entrepreneurs are able to see new places the world can go, and how to get it there simply through the conviction behind their ideas and their energy. I became determined to help these creative, passionate individuals achieve their goals in any way possible.",Tom Holahan,General Catalyst
"Before joining General Catalyst, I built strategic partnerships to accelerate product adoption at Datadog, a SaaS infrastructure and application performance monitoring company. Knowing what day-to-day life is like inside a high-growth, venture-backed company will always be one of my assets as an investor.",Tom Holahan,General Catalyst
"My primary focus at General Catalyst is identifying stand out later-stage companies that are enabled by software and technology. The opportunity to work with a diverse group of founders and companies is tremendous and something I value, as my own personal background has been shaped by individuals from all walks of life.",Tom Holahan,General Catalyst
"I played football at Amherst, while earning a degree in political science. Whenever I can, I get outdoors to play pick-up sports or go hiking or skiing. I’m proud to be active with Cambridge-based Soccer Without Borders, an organization focused on the sport to empower under-served youth. If the weather forces me inside, I’m probably hanging with friends and checking out New England’s amazing craft beer scene.",Tom Holahan,General Catalyst
"“As venture investors, we are invited guests to your journey. The most important role we can play is to be the first-call, not just when things are going great… but especially when there are hard problems to solve.”",Trevor Oelschig,General Catalyst
"My investment thesis is simple: look for opportunities in individuals. Specifically, I’m most interested in people who live — and have an intrinsic understanding of — the business they’re building. They’re not shy about it either. Their aim is to create a fundamentally better consumer experience to take on an established market or to create an entirely new one.",Trevor Oelschig,General Catalyst
"At General Catalyst, I focus on the application layer with special attention paid to user-centric products with a sneaky potential to become hugely useful in enterprises.
